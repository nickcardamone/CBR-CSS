abstract="Cultivating strong partnerships among community and academic stakeholders expedites the translation of research findings into practice and communities by enhancing opportunities for research dissemination and implementation. However, the lack of systematic methods for community stakeholder engagement may decelerate the translational research process. The North Carolina Translational Research and Clinical Sciences Institute implemented an innovative approach to community engagement called the Action Learning Cohort (ALC) Series. The ALC Series, a workgroup extension of a professional conference, used action learning and systems thinking strategies to conceptualize and develop a product aimed at preventing, treating, and controlling hypertension in eastern North Carolina. We evaluated the acceptability and practicality of the ALC Series using survey, focus group, and interview pilot data. Action learning and systems thinking strategies led ALC stakeholders to develop and disseminate The Empathy Building Resource Guide: A Toolkit for Enhancing Patient-Provider Relationships in the Treatment, Management, and Prevention of Hypertension. Stakeholders rated the Series as satisfactory and acknowledged gains in knowledge and desire for engagement with fellow ALC stakeholders beyond the Series. The ALC Series approach is a potentially practical and acceptable model for systematically engaging community stakeholders in translating knowledge into a product that addresses health topics like hypertension.",

volume="21",
pages="21",
abstract="BACKGROUND: Stakeholder participation optimizes health planning, fostering the acceptability and integration of new health services. Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing challenges in the development, implementation and evaluation of community pharmacy services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the foundation for building collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care. OBJECTIVES: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a collaborative initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in Andalucia (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders, differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder relationships. METHOD: Stakeholders were identified using the snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders and analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire was sent to 186 stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5) concerns; (6) whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they had with other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive qualitative content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis and social network analysis. RESULTS: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6{\%}) participated. The identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public health and science were the main driving interests. A collaboration network existed between the 96 stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the magnitude of the social system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. A large array of stakeholders was identified and analyzed, and a group of critical stakeholders selected. Stakeholder characteristics such as attitude toward the initiative, potential contribution, desire for involvement, and the existing collaboration network, provided complementary information that was helpful for planning the process and stakeholder engagement.",

title="Using developmental evaluation to support knowledge translation: reflections from a large-scale quality improvement project in Indigenous primary healthcare",
journal="Health Research Policy {\&} Systems",
year="Jul 19",
volume="17",
number="1",
pages="70",
abstract="BACKGROUND: Developmental evaluation is a growing area of evaluation practice, advocated for informing the adaptive development of change initiatives in complex social environments. The utilisation focus, complexity perspective and systems thinking of developmental evaluation suggest suitability for evaluating knowledge translation initiatives in primary healthcare. However, there are few examples in the literature to guide its use in these contexts and in Indigenous settings. In this paper, we reflect on our experience of using developmental evaluation to implement a large-scale knowledge translation research project in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary healthcare. Drawing on principles of knowledge translation and key features of developmental evaluation, we debate the key benefits and challenges of applying this approach to engage diverse stakeholders in using aggregated quality improvement data to identify and address persistent gaps in care delivery. DISCUSSION: The developmental evaluation enabled the team to respond to stakeholder feedback and apply learning in real-time to successfully refine theory-informed research and engagement processes, tailor the presentation of findings to stakeholders and context, and support the project's dissemination and knowledge co-production aim. It thereby contributed to the production of robust, useable research findings for informing policy and system change. The use of developmental evaluation appeared to positively influence stakeholders' use of the project reports and their responses to the findings. Challenges included managing a high volume of evaluation data and multiple evaluation purposes, balancing facilitative sense-making processes and change with task-focused project management, and lack of experience in using this evaluation approach. Use of an embedded evaluator with facilitation skills and background knowledge of the project helped to overcome these challenges, as did similarities observed between features of developmental evaluation and continuous quality improvement. CONCLUSION: Our experience of developmental evaluation confirmed our expectations of the potential value of this approach for strengthening improvement interventions and implementation research, and particularly for adapting healthcare innovations in Indigenous settings. In our project, developmental evaluation successfully encompassed evaluation, project adaptation, capacity development and knowledge translation. Further work is warranted to apply this approach more widely to improve primary healthcare initiatives and outcomes, and to evaluate implementation research.",

volume="14",
number="6",
pages="e0218875",
abstract="BACKGROUND: System science approaches are increasingly used to explore complex public health problems. Quantitative methods, such as participatory dynamic simulation modelling, can mobilise knowledge to inform health policy decisions. However, the analytic and practical steps required to turn collaboratively developed, qualitative system maps into rigorous and policy-relevant quantified dynamic simulation models are not well described. This paper reports on the processes, interactions and decisions that occurred at the interface between modellers and end-user participants in an applied health sector case study focusing on diabetes in pregnancy. METHODS: An analysis was conducted using qualitative data from a participatory dynamic simulation modelling case study in an Australian health policy setting. Recordings of participatory model development workshops and subsequent meetings were analysed and triangulated with field notes and other written records of discussions and decisions. Case study vignettes were collated to illustrate the deliberations and decisions made throughout the model development process. RESULTS: The key analytic objectives and decision-making processes included: defining the model scope; analysing and refining the model structure to maximise local relevance and utility; reviewing and incorporating evidence to inform model parameters and assumptions; focusing the model on priority policy questions; communicating results and applying the models to policy processes. These stages did not occur sequentially; the model development was cyclical and iterative with decisions being re-visited and refined throughout the process. Storytelling was an effective strategy to both communicate and resolve concerns about the model logic and structure, and to communicate the outputs of the model to a broader audience. CONCLUSION: The in-depth analysis reported here examined the application of participatory modelling methods to move beyond qualitative conceptual mapping to the development of a rigorously quantified and policy relevant, complex dynamic simulation model. The analytic objectives and decision-making themes identified provide guidance for interpreting, understanding and reporting future participatory modelling projects and methods.",

pages="e01677",
abstract="A topic of primary importance for organizations is the ability to identify and appraise Social Media Influencers (SMIs), given their key role in affecting conversations and interactions on social media. According to the current research in this area, influencers make up a single category of social media users, but only limited attention has been paid concerning the extent to which they can exert their influence. In this study, the quantification and classification of SMIs is addressed by proposing an advanced methodology based on social network analysis - K-shell decomposition - together with a discussion on the relationship between the different SMI categories and the effect of each type of influencer on the public relation activity of an organization. The developed methodology was tested through an action research project conducted at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan, and the results were then discussed with the management of the opera house. The main finding of this work is that SMIs can be split into writers, authorities or spreaders on the basis of the kind of influence they exert, thereby delivering a precisely focused typology of SMIs. These findings enhance our academic knowledge on analytics applied to social science, while also providing a real case situation where managers make practical use of analytics.",

title="Achieving meaningful participation of people who use drugs and their peer organizations in a strategic research partnership",
journal="Harm Reduction Journal",
year="Jun 10",
volume="16",
number="1",
pages="37",
abstract="BACKGROUND: Peer-led programs with people who use drugs (PWUD) have been a key characteristic of the harm reduction in many countries, including their involvement in research. However, peer involvement in research is often limited to recruitment, consultation, and reporting back, rather than a genuine collaboration in the priority setting, design, and conduct of research. PWUD peer organizations face ongoing challenges to demonstrate the depth of their knowledge of current and emerging issues within drug-using networks and the value of their peer insights for effective research and policy. The identification of benefits, barriers, and enablers for meaningful participation of PWUD in research has often been limited to methodological rather than system level factors. METHODS: This paper draws on the experiences and findings of the What Works and Why (W3) Project, a 5-year collaborative study with peer organizations. The study drew on systems thinking methods to develop a framework to demonstrate the role of peer organizations within their community and policy systems. The study required peer staff and researchers to undertake the simultaneous role of drivers, participants, and analysts in the research. To identify the learnings in relation to meaningful participation of PWUD peer organizations in research, we drew together the insights and experiences of peer staff and researchers across the 5 years of the study RESULTS: The W3 Project provided insights into the nuances of community-engaged research practice and the ongoing benefits, barriers, and enablers to the meaningful participation of PWUD and their peer organizations. These included system-level barriers and enablers beyond individual research projects or methodology. The capacity of research and peer organizations to maintain meaningful peer participation in research can be restricted or enhanced by the systems in which they are embedded. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing peer organizations as active participants and drivers within community and policy systems can help clarify their unique and critical role in research. Achieving meaningful collaboration with PWUD peer organizations requires looking beyond good practice methods to the system-level factors with attention to the system-level benefits, barriers, and enablers.",

title="Process evaluation of the healthy primary School of the Future: the key learning points",
journal="BMC Public Health",
year="Jun 06",
volume="19",
number="1",
pages="698",
abstract="BACKGROUND: While schools have potential to contribute to children's health and healthy behaviour, embedding health promotion within complex school systems is challenging. The 'Healthy Primary School of the Future' (HPSF) is an initiative that aims to integrate health and well-being into school systems. Central to HPSF are two top-down changes that are hypothesized as being positively disruptive to the Dutch school system: daily free healthy lunches and structured physical activity sessions. These changes are expected to create momentum for bottom-up processes leading to additional health-promoting changes. Using a programme theory, this paper explores the processes through which HPSF and the school context adapt to one another. The aim is to generate and share knowledge and experiences on how to implement changes in the complex school system to integrate school health promotion. METHODS: The current study involved a mixed methods process evaluation with a contextual action-oriented research approach. The processes of change were investigated in four Dutch primary schools during the development year (2014-2015) and the first two years of implementation (2015-2017) of HPSF. The schools (each with 15-26 teachers and 233-389 children) were in low socio-economic status areas. Measurements included interviews, questionnaires, observations, and analysis of minutes of meetings. RESULTS: Top-down advice, combined with bottom-up involvement and external practical support were key facilitators in embedding HPSF within the schools' contexts. Sufficient coordination and communication at the school level, team cohesion, and feedback loops enhanced implementation of the changes. Implementation of the healthy lunch appeared to be disruptive and create momentum for additional health-promoting changes. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating highly visible positive disruptions to improve school health can act as a catalyst for wider school health promotion efforts. Conditions to create a positive disruption are enough time, and sufficient bottom-up involvement, external support, team cohesion and coordination. The focus should be on each specific school, as each school has their own starting point and process of change. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database on 14 June 2016 (NCT02800616).",

pages="1029-1040",
abstract="BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) is a multifactorial problem with complex interactions among many biological, psychological and social factors. It is difficult to fully appreciate this complexity because the knowledge necessary to do so is distributed over many areas of expertise that span the biopsychosocial domains. PURPOSE: This study describes the collaborative modeling process, undertaken among a group of participants with diverse expertise in LBP, to build a model to enhance understanding and communicate the complexity of the LBP problem. STUDY DESIGN: The study involved generating individual models that represented participants' understanding of the LBP problem using fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), and 4 subsequent phases of consultation and consensus with the participants to characterize and refine the interpretation of the FCMs. METHODS: The phases consisted of: proposal of Categories for clustering of model Components; preliminary evaluation of structure, composition and focal areas of participant's FCMs; refinement of Categories and Components with consensus meeting; generation of final structure and composition of individual participant's FCMs. Descriptive statistics were applied to the structural and composition metrics of individual FCMs to aid interpretation. RESULTS: From 38 invited contributors, 29 (76{\%}) agreed to participate. They represented 9 disciplines and 8 countries. Participants' models included 729 Components, with an average of 25 (SD=7) per model. After the final FCM refinement process (Components from separate FCMs that used similar terms were combined, and Components from an FCM that included multiple terms were separated), there were 147 Components allocated to ten Categories. Although individual models varied in their structure and composition, a common opinion emerged that psychological factors are particularly important in the presentation of LBP. Collectively, Components allocated to the ``Psychology'' Category were the most central in almost half (14/29) of the individual models. CONCLUSIONS: The collaborative modeling process outlined in this paper provides a foundation upon which to build a greater understanding and to communicate the complexity of the LBP problem. The next step is to aggregate individual FCMs into a metamodel and begin disentangling the interactions among its Components. This will lead to an improved understanding of the complexity of LBP, and hopefully to improved outcomes for those suffering from this condition.",

journal="Jamba",
year="2019",
volume="11",
number="1",
pages="597",
abstract="Food production in developing countries has been highly susceptible to both climatic and non-climatic stressors. To identify the factors that prevent the rural poor from producing food efficiently, various participatory methodologies have been utilised. However, most methodologies have implicitly illustrated how vulnerable the livelihood activities of the poor are from an asset-based perspective. As assets give people the capability to thrive, we make a case for the asset vulnerability analytical framework (AVAF) and systems thinking (ST) as an integrated methodological framework. Data for this study were obtained from the rural Delta State of Nigeria through the principles and traditions of participatory research, which include Venn (or institutional) diagrams, transect walks, brainstorming, community risk mapping and historical timelines. Findings indicate that the AVAF, on the one hand, will make it relatively easier for development practitioners to effectively identify the factors that undermine the poor's ability to maximise their livelihood assets during food production. The ST, on the other hand, will enable development practitioners to visualise the long-term consequences of the continued inability of the poor to maximise their livelihood assets. This article argues that the utilisation of both AVAF and ST will simplify the complex challenges of decision-making. This, in turn, will facilitate the implementation of appropriate policy interventions to protect the crucial assets necessary for the rural poor to produce their food efficiently and sustainably. <b>Keywords:</b> asset vulnerability analytical framework; systems thinking; subsistence farmers; Delta State; Nigeria.",

volume="9",
number="3",
pages="e024681",
abstract="INTRODUCTION: Translating scientific advances in genomic medicine into evidence-based clinical practice is challenging. Studying the natural translation of genomics into 'early-adopting' health system sectors is essential. We will (a) examine 29 health systems (Australian and Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance flagships) integrating genomics into practice and (b) combine this learning to co-design and test an evidence-based generalisable toolkit for translating genomics into healthcare. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Twenty-nine flagships integrating genomics into clinical settings are studied as complex adaptive systems to understand emergent and self-organising behaviours among inter-related actors and processes. The Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid approach is applied to gather information on the delivery and potential for real-world implementation. Stages '1' and '2a' (representing hybrid model 1) are the focus of this protocol. The Translation Science to Population Impact (TSci Impact) framework is used to study policy decisions and service provision, and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is used to understand individual level behavioural change; both frameworks are applied across stages 1 and 2a. Stage 1 synthesises interview data from 32 participants involved in developing the genomics clinical practice systems and approaches across five 'demonstration-phase' (early adopter) flagships. In stage 2a, stakeholders are providing quantitative and qualitative data on process mapping, clinical audits, uptake and sustainability (TSci Impact), and psychosocial and environmental determinants of change (TDF). Findings will be synthesised before codesigning an intervention toolkit to facilitate implementation of genomic testing. Study methods to simultaneously test the comparative effectiveness of genomic testing and the implementation toolkit (stage 2b), and the refined implementation toolkit while simply observing the genomics intervention (stage 3) are summarised. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted. The results will be disseminated in academic forums and used to refine interventions to translate genomics evidence into healthcare. Non-traditional academic dissemination methods (eg, change in guidelines or government policy) will also be employed.",

title="Household air pollution in Nairobi's slums: A long-term policy evaluation using participatory system dynamics",
journal="Science of the Total Environment",
year="Apr 10",
volume="660",
pages="1108-1134",
abstract="58{\%} of Nairobi's population live in informal settlements in extremely poor conditions. Household air pollution is one of the leading causes of premature death and disease in these settlements. Regulatory frameworks and government budgets for household air pollution do not exist and humanitarian organisations remain largely inattentive and inactive on this issue. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of potential indoor-air related policies, as identified together with various stakeholders, in lowering household air pollution in Nairobi's slums. Applying a novel approach in this context, we used participatory system dynamics within a series of stakeholder workshops in Nairobi, to map and model the complex dynamics surrounding household air pollution and draw up possible policy options. Workshop participants included community members, local and national policy-makers, representatives from parastatals, NGOs and academics. Simulation modelling demonstrates that under business-as-usual, the current trend of slowly improving indoor air quality will soon come to a halt. If we aim to continue to substantially reduce household PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels, a drastic acceleration in the uptake of clean stoves is needed. We identified the potentially high impact of redirecting investment towards household air quality monitoring and health impact assessment studies, therefore raising the public's and the government's awareness and concern about this issue and its health consequences. Such investments, due to their self-reinforcing nature, can entail high returns on investment, but are likely to give 'worse-before-better' results due to the time lags involved. We also discuss the usefulness of the participatory process within similar multi-stakeholder contexts. With important implications for such settings this work advances our understanding of the efficacy of high-level policy options for reducing household air pollution. It makes a case for the usefulness of participatory system dynamics for such complex, multi-stakeholder, environmental issues.",

title="Using landscape scenarios to improve local nitrogen management and planning",
journal="Journal of Environmental Management",
year="Feb 15",
volume="232",
pages="523-530",
abstract="Scenario-building is a widely used tool to initiate discussions on future land uses. In scenarios possible futures can be explored and peoples' ideas as well as societal trends can be visualized by the use of maps, pictures and figures. With focus on agricultural nitrogen management, and point of departure in the farmers' decisions-regarding fertilizer inputs, crop rotations, land use, and drainage, landscape scenarios are formulated based on local ideas for future nitrogen management and general prospects for local development. The key research question addressed in this paper is how landscape scenarios can guide farmers to improve nitrogen management in smaller catchments dominated by farming. Participatory modelling was used to develop landscape scenarios, depicting the change of nitrogen emission as a result of changes in landscape management and agricultural practices. In the development of the scenarios we used an ArcMap based tool combining statistical data, experimental knowledge, nitrate leaching modelling and input from local stakeholders on biophysical as well as land use and farm management issues. The scenarios presented are the result of a collaborative planning experiment within the frames of the dNmark research alliance on nitrogen. Three different types of scenarios are presented and discussed and their effects in terms of N reduction are estimated. The three scenarios were called: River valley set-aside, constructed wetlands, and land zonation. All the modelled scenarios are estimated to have a positive effect i.e. a reduction of the level of N leached to the root zone. Based on the experience gathered in the project, the feasibility of using scenarios for future environmental planning in the agricultural landscapes is discussed. Further, this is related to the current discussion in Denmark on geographically targeted nitrogen regulation. It is concluded that the co-creative approach to formulation of scenarios can be an effective way of increasing the knowledge and ownership of possible future solutions, however the cost associated with this planning approach is likely to substantially higher that more traditional planning approaches. Consequently, the estimated transactions costs should be weighed against the expected benefits in terms of more successful implementation.",

abstract="The process of systematically developing a sustainability vision is an important element of effective environmental management. Sustainability visions can, however, include contradictions and counterintuitive effects due to complex system behavior (e.g., feedback loops, multi-causality) and ambiguous system boundaries (e.g., choice of a scale, such as a regional or national scale). This paper proposes an innovative methodological framework for vision design and assessment (VDA) to analyze the sustainability of future visions on multiple scales with consideration of ecosystem services, and to test their plausibility based upon expert and local knowledge. First, requirements and functions of visionary system designs are identified. Second, a functional organizational analysis defines structures and processes that generate functions. Third, a literature review and participatory modeling process are conducted to analyze the system structures of visionary system designs using causal loop diagrams. Fourth, fuzzy cognitive mapping is used to assess visions based upon sustainability indicators. A case study on sustainable food systems in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, is provided to demonstrate the application of the methodology. Three designs of a sustainable food system were analyzed and tested: urban organic gardening, a local diversified organic food system and a globalized commodity-based organic food system. The results show the advantages and disadvantages of each system design and underline the sustainability benefits of a multi-scale food system based upon a combination of system designs.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Especially patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery are prone to develop frailty-related complications that may go far beyond the index hospitalization (e.g., cognitive impairment following postoperative delirium). However, aging-relevant information are currently not fully integrated into hospitals' perioperative processes. METHODS: We introduce a temporal perspective, which focuses on the social construction of time, to better understand existing barriers to the exchange of frailty-related data, targeting complexity research. Our chosen context is perioperative care provided by a tertiary hospital in Germany that has implemented a special track for patients over 65 years old undergoing elective surgery. The research followed a participatory modelling approach between domain and modelling experts with the goal of creating a feedback loop model of the relevant system relationships and dynamics. RESULTS: The results of the study show how disparate temporal regimes, understood as frameworks for organizing actions in the light of time constraints, time pressure, and deadlines, across different clinical, ambulant, and geriatric care sectors create disincentives to cooperate in frailty-related data exchanges. Moreover, we find that shifting baselines, meaning continuous increases in cost and time pressure in individual sectors, may unintentionally reinforce - rather than discourage - disparate temporal regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results may (1) help to increase awareness of the importance of frailty-related data exchanges, and (2) impel efforts aiming to transform treatment processes to go beyond sectoral boundaries, taking into account the potential benefits for frail patients arising from integrated care processes using information technology.",

abstract="Engaging youth from racial and ethnic minority communities as leaders for change is a potential strategy to mobilize support for addressing childhood obesity, but there are limited curricula designed to help youth understand the complex influences on obesity. Our aim was to develop and pilot test a systems science curriculum to elicit rural African American youth perspectives on childhood obesity and enhance their understanding of and support for obesity prevention solutions. The curriculum was designed so it could be integrated with existing positive youth development curricula that help youth advocate for and implement identified solutions. We conducted four workshop sessions with youth that engaged them in systems learning activities such as guided systems diagramming activities. The participants ( n = 21) completed validated surveys presession and postsession that assessed their causal attributions of obesity and support for obesity prevention policies. The youths' perception that environmental factors cause obesity increased ( p < .05), and perceptions that individual behavior and biology cause obesity did not change. Their support for policies that addressed food access and food pricing significantly increased ( p < .05). The youths' system diagrams elucidated links between multilevel factors such as personal attitudes, social influence, and the built environment, which provides important information for designing synergistic solutions. The changes we observed in youths' perceptions of obesity and support for policy changes have important implications for youths' interest and willingness to advocate for social and environmental changes in their community. The strategies have a promising role in supporting community mobilization to address childhood obesity.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Ensuring effective identification and management of sepsis is a healthcare priority in many countries. Recommendations for sepsis management in primary care have been produced, but in complex healthcare systems, an in-depth understanding of current system interactions and functioning is often essential before improvement interventions can be successfully designed and implemented. A structured participatory design approach to model a primary care system was employed to hypothesise gaps between work as intended and work delivered to inform improvement and implementation priorities for sepsis management. METHODS: In a Scottish regional health authority, multiple stakeholders were interviewed and the records of patients admitted from primary care to hospital with possible sepsis analysed. This identified the key work functions required to manage these patients successfully, the influence of system conditions (such as resource availability) and the resulting variability of function output. This information was used to model the system using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). The multiple stakeholder interviews also explored perspectives on system improvement needs which were subsequently themed. The FRAM model directed an expert group to reconcile improvement suggestions with current work systems and design an intervention to improve clinical management of sepsis. RESULTS: Fourteen key system functions were identified, and a FRAM model was created. Variability was found in the output of all functions. The overall system purpose and improvement priorities were agreed. Improvement interventions were reconciled with the FRAM model of current work to understand how best to implement change, and a multi-component improvement intervention was designed. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional improvement approaches often focus on individual performance or a specific care process, rather than seeking to understand and improve overall performance in a complex system. The construction of the FRAM model facilitated an understanding of the complexity of interactions within the current system, how system conditions influence everyday sepsis management and how proposed interventions would work within the context of the current system. This directed the design of a multi-component improvement intervention that organisations could locally adapt and implement with the aim of improving overall system functioning and performance to improve sepsis management.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Multiple structural, contextual and individual factors determine social disadvantage and affect health experience. There is limited understanding, however, of how this complex system works to shape access to health enabling resources (HER), especially for most marginalised or hard-to-reach populations. As a result, planning continues to be bereft of voices and lived realities of those in the margins. This paper reports on key findings and experience of a participatory action research (PAR) that aimed to deepen understanding of how multiple disadvantages (and structures of oppression) interact to produce difference in access to resources affecting well-being in disadvantaged communities in Edinburgh. METHODS: An innovative approach combining intersectionality and PAR was adopted and operationalised in three overlapping phases. A preparatory phase helped establish relationships with participant groups and policy stakeholders, and challenge assumptions underlying the study design. Field-work and analysis was conducted iteratively in two phases: with a range of participants working in policy and community roles (or 'bridge' populations), followed by residents of one Edinburgh locality with relatively high levels of deprivation (As measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, a geographically-based indicator. See http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/DataAnalysis/SPconstituencyprofile/EdinburghNorthern-Leith ). Traditional qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups) alongside participatory methods (health resource mapping, spider-grams, photovoice) were employed to facilitate action-oriented knowledge production among multiply disadvantaged groups. RESULTS: There was considerable agreement across groups and communities as to what healthful living (in general) means. This entailed a combination of material, environmental, socio-cultural and affective resources including: a sense of belonging and of purpose, feeling valued, self-esteem, safe/secure housing, reliable income, and access to responsive and sensitive health care when needed. Differences emerge in the value placed by people at different social locations on these resources. The conditions/aspects of their living environment that affected their access to and ability to translate these resources into improved health also appeared to vary with social location. CONCLUSION: Integrating intersectionality with PAR enables the generation of a fuller understanding of disparities in the distribution of, and access to, HER, notably from the standpoint of those excluded from mainstream policy and planning processes. Employing an intersectionality lens helped illuminate links between individual subjectivities and wider social structures and power relations. PAR on the other hand offered the potential to engage multiply disadvantaged groups in a process to collectively build local knowledge for action to develop healthier communities and towards positive community-led social change.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been integrated in national quality registries or specific national monitoring initiatives to inform the improvement of quality of care on a national scale. However there are many unanswered questions, such as: how these systems are set up, whether they lead to improved quality of care, which stakeholders use the information once it is available. The aim of this study was to examine supporting and hindering factors relevant to integrating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in selected health information systems (HIS) tailored toward improving quality of care across the entire health system. METHODS: First, a systematic search and review was conducted to outline previously identified factors relevant to the integration of PROMs in the selected HIS. A social network analysis was performed to identify networks of experts in these systems. Second, expert interviews were conducted to discuss and elaborate on the identified factors. Directive content analysis was applied using a HIS Evaluation Framework as the frame of reference. This framework is structured into four components: Organization, Human, Technology, and Net benefits. RESULTS: The literature review revealed 37 papers for the NHS PROMs Programme and 26 papers for the SHPR and SKAR: Five networks of researchers were identified for the NHS PROMs Programme and 1 for the SHPR and SKAR. Seven experts related to the NHS PROMs Programme and 3 experts related to the SKAR and SHPR participated in the study. The main themes which revealed in relation to Organization were Governance and Capacity building; to Human: Reporting and Stakeholder Engagement; to Technology: the Selection and Collection of PROMs and Data linkage. In relation to Net benefits, system-specific considerations are presented. CONCLUSION: Both examples succeeded in integrating PROMs into HIS on a national scale. The lack of an established standard on what change PROMs should be achieved by an intervention limits their usefulness for monitoring quality of care. Whether the PROMs data collected within these systems can be used in routine clinical practice is considered a challenge in both countries.",

The approach is applied to a case of urban air pollution caused by residential heating with wood in central Chile. The results show how the households' behavior interrelates with the governmental management strategies and provide valuable and novel insights into potential challenges to the implementation of policies to manage the local air pollution problem. The experience further shows that the developed participatory modeling approach allows to overcome some of the issues currently encountered in the elicitation of individuals' behavioral rationales and in the quantification of qualitative information.",

abstract="In 2013, South Carolina implemented a multi-year program providing support services for pregnant and parenting teens. Local lead sites were responsible for coordinating service delivery in partnership with other multidisciplinary community-based organizations. We used social network theory and analyses (SNA) to examine changes in partnerships over time. Using two-stage purposeful sampling, we identified three lead sites and their self-reported community partners. We administered two web-based surveys grounded in social network theory that included questions about partnership relationships and organizational characteristics. We calculated selected whole-network measures (size, cohesion, equity, diversity). Following the Year 1 surveys, we reviewed our findings with the lead sites and suggested opportunities to strengthen their respective partnerships. Following the Year 3 surveys, we observed changes across the networks. Survey response rates were 91.5{\%} (43/47) in Year 1 and 68.2{\%} (45/66) in Year 3. By Year 3, the average network size increased from 15.6 to 20.3 organizations. By Year 3, one lead site doubled its measure of network cohesion (connectedness); another lead site doubled in size (capacity). A third lead site, highly dense in Year 1, increased in size but decreased in cohesion by Year 3. Innovative use of SNA findings can help community partnerships identify gaps in capacity or services and organizations needed to fulfill program aims. SNA findings can also improve partnership function by identifying opportunities to improve connectedness or reduce redundancies in program work. The ability of lead sites to strategically reconfigure partnerships can be important to program success and sustainability.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: Studies of community-based obesity prevention interventions have hypothesized that stakeholder networks are a critical element of effective implementation. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of stakeholders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention interventions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp {\&} Chomp (R{\&}C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS), USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall. Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period, along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each relationship. RESULTS: Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering committee and 8 participants from the R{\&}C steering committee. On average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with approximately half of the relationships described as 'close' and 30{\%} as 'influential'. The 'discussion' and 'close' networks had high clustering and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members, and to individuals external to the committee. In contrast, influential ties were more prominently directed internal to the steering committee, with higher network centralization, lower reciprocity and lower clustering. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Social network analysis provides a method to evaluate the ties within steering committees of community-based obesity prevention interventions. In this study, the network characteristics between a sub-set of stakeholders appeared to be supportive of diffused communication. Future work should prospectively examine stakeholder network structures in a heterogeneous sample of community-based interventions to identify elements most strongly associated with intervention effectiveness.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Systems thinking represents an innovative and logical approach to understanding complexity in community-based obesity prevention interventions. We report on an approach to apply systems thinking to understand the complexity of a successful obesity prevention intervention in early childhood (children aged up to 5 years) conducted in a regional city in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: A causal loop diagram (CLD) was developed to represent system elements related to a successful childhood obesity prevention intervention in early childhood. Key stakeholder interviews (n = 16) were examined retrospectively to generate purposive text data, create microstructures, and form a CLD. RESULTS: A CLD representing key stakeholder perceptions of a successful intervention comprised six key feedback loops explaining changes in project implementation over time. The loops described the dynamics of collaboration, network formation, community awareness, human resources, project clarity, and innovation. CONCLUSION: The CLD developed provides a replicable means to capture, evaluate and disseminate a description of the dynamic elements of a successful obesity prevention intervention in early childhood.",

abstract="Successful management of complex social-ecological landscapes overlapping Natura 2000 sites requires collaboration between various actors such as law enforcement agencies, NGOs and enterprises. Natura 2000 governance is stimulated by central actors (e.g., Natura 2000 administrators), with successes and failures of management activities depending on the capacity of the network leader to implement a collaborative approach to environmental governance. By using social network analysis, we analysed the cooperation, information flow and capacity for collective action within Natura 2000 governance networks within two Romanian protected areas: Lower Siret Floodplain and Iron Gates Natural Park. The two networks represent protected areas managed by different types of organisations (i.e., Lower Siret Floodplain - by an NGO, Iron Gates Natural Park - by a public entity). Taking into consideration that NGOs may favour an adaptive co-management, while the public bodies may take a top-down management approach, we hypothesize that Lower Siret Floodplain will have a more cohesive and collaborating network compared to Iron Gates Natural Park, and that there will be a greater representation of private and NGO sector in the network coordinated by Lower Siret Floodplain. Contrary to our expectations, the results show that collaboration patterns are similar in the two networks, although they are governed by two different types of institutions, both being less participative than expected, with low involvement of NGOs and private stakeholders. Furthermore, Lower Siret Floodplain network is surprisingly more centralized around a small number of public authorities, and the pre-existing power of public bodies likely inhibit the capacity of the NGO to collaborate with private stakeholders. We also found lower collaboration levels between actors in the network periphery with other organisations from the same cluster, denoting a clear top-down approach of the management in both networks. Our findings suggest that delegating the protected areas administration to NGOs, a solution to increase the use of co-management in protected areas, does not solve the poor representation of private stakeholders.",

abstract="Zoonotic diseases, transmitted from animals to humans, are a public health challenge in developing countries. Livestock value chain actors have an important role to play as the first line of defence in safeguarding public health. However, although the livelihood and economic impacts of zoonoses are widely known, adoption of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing zoonoses is low, particularly among actors in informal livestock value chains in low and middle-income countries. The main objective of this study was to investigate knowledge of zoonoses and adoption of biosecurity measures by livestock and milk value chain actors in Bura, Tana River County, in Kenya, where cattle, camels, sheep and goats are the main livestock kept. The study utilised a mixed methods approach, with a questionnaire survey administered to 154 value chain actors. Additional information was elicited through key informant interviews and participatory methods with relevant stakeholders outside the value chain. Our results found low levels of knowledge of zoonoses and low levels of adherence to food safety standards, with only 37{\%} of milk traders knowing about brucellosis, in spite of a sero-prevalence of 9{\%} in the small ruminants tested in this study, and no slaughterhouse worker knew about Q fever. Actors had little formal education (between 0 and 10{\%}) and lacked training in food safety and biosecurity measures. Adoption of biosecurity measures by value chain actors was very low or non-existent, with only 11{\%} of butchers wearing gloves. There was a gendered dimension, evidenced by markedly different participation in value chains and lower adoption rates and knowledge levels among female actors. Finally, cultural and religious practices were shown to play an important role in exposure and transmission of diseases, influencing perceptions and attitudes to risks and adoption of biosecurity measures.",

The study analyzed qualitative data collected through interviews, participant observations, and document reviews. RESULTS: The study found that the design of the PAS was unsuitable to the work of the three units of the OTD. Based on the diagnoses and STS theory, the project developed and implemented a successful intervention to enhance the legacy system for data entries in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the value of AR from a socio-technical perspective for improving existing systems in healthcare settings. The steps adopted in this study could be applied to improve similar systems. A follow-up study will be essential to assess the sustainability of the improved system.",

abstract="Participatory modeling aims to incorporate stakeholders into the process of developing models for the purpose of eliciting information, appropriately reflecting stakeholder interests and concerns, and improving stakeholder understanding, and acceptance of the analysis. Participatory modeling, using causal loop diagramming (CLD), was used to explore the impact of climate change on public health in Long Beach, California. CLD, commonly used in participatory modeling, provided useful information to serve as the basis for a quantitative system dynamics model to protect the citizens of Long Beach, and potentially other cities or regions affected by climate change. Diverse stakeholders constructed CLDs depicting the impacts of climate change on public health in Long Beach. This exercise aimed to (1) identify public health issues that might be caused or exacerbated by climate change; (2) examine the systemic connections between climate change and other drivers of public health/illness and mortality; and (3) identify feedback loops to gain an understanding of how climate change could impact public health over coming decades. Six groups of five stakeholders were tasked with depicting the impacts of climate change on public health. Each group designated a key health outcome of concern on a citywide scale, including critical drivers of the outcome at higher and lower scales if necessary (for example, state laws, or household-level decisions that affect health outcomes in the aggregate). Social, environmental, political, and economic variables were all considered. After the small group diagramming exercise, groups presented diagram results to other participants, and the discussion around the diagrams was recorded.",

The GetHealthyHeights.org CEHI platform was implemented in an urban low-income community. It was designed to facilitate connectivity among health-related community-based organizations (CBOs). To evaluate the process towards and the achievement of connectivity, a conceptual framework, methodology, and operational measures were defined. A system-level approach, such as social network analysis, is required to capture the community as one dynamic unit. The evaluation framework specifies network connectivity metrics based on a social network survey. A network survey of CBOs (n=35) at baseline demonstrates utility of social network data for characterizing connectivity among community resources.

abstract="BACKGROUND: Engagement is essential in trials research but is rarely embedded across all stages of the research continuum. The development, use, effectiveness and value of engagement in trials research is poorly researched and understood, and models of engagement are rarely informed by theory. This article describes an innovative methodological approach for the development and application of a relational model of engagement in a stepped wedge designed cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), the CORE study. The purpose of the model is to embed engagement across the continuum of the trial which will test if an experience-based co-design intervention improves psychosocial recovery for people affected by severe mental illness. METHODS: The model was developed in three stages and used a structured iterative approach. A context mapping assessment of trial sites was followed by a literature review on recruitment and retention of hard-to-reach groups in complex interventions and RCTs. Relevant theoretical and philosophical underpinnings were identified by an additional review of literature to inform model development and enactment of engagement activities. RESULTS: Policy, organisational and service user data combined with evidence from the literature on barriers to recruitment provided contextual information. Four perspectives support the theoretical framework of the relational model of engagement and this is organised around two facets: the relational and continuous. The relational facet is underpinned by relational ethical theories and participatory action research principles. The continuous facet is supported by systems thinking and translation theories. These combine to enact an ethics of engagement and evoke knowledge mobilisation to reach the higher order goals of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement models are invaluable for trials research, but there are opportunities to advance their theoretical development and application, particularly within stepped wedge designed studies where there may be a significant waiting period between enrolment in a study and receipt of an intervention.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Process evaluation is recommended to improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms related to clinicians, patients, context and intervention delivery that may impact on trial or program results, feasibility and transferability to practice. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the Prescribe Healthy Life (PVS from the Spanish ``Prescribe Vida Saludable'') implementation strategy for enhancing the adoption and implementation of an evidence-based health promotion intervention in primary health care. METHODS: A descriptive study of 2-year implementation indicators for the PVS clinical intervention was conducted in four primary health care centers. A multifaceted collaborative modeling implementation strategy was developed to enhance the integration of a clinical intervention to promote healthy lifestyles into clinical practice. Process indicators were assessed for intervention reach, adoption, implementation, sustainability and their variability at center, practice, and patient levels. RESULTS: Mean rates of adoption by means of active collaboration among the three main professional categories (family physicians, nurses and administrative personnel) were 75{\%} in all centers. Just over half of the patients that attended (n = 11650; 51.9{\%}) were reached in terms of having their lifestyle habits assessed, while more than a third (33.7{\%}; n = 7433) and almost 10{\%} (n = 2175) received advice or a printed prescription for at least one lifestyle change, respectively. Only 3.7{\%} of the target population received a repeat prescription. These process indicators significantly (p < 0.001) varied by center, lifestyle habit and patient characteristics. Sustainability of intervention components changed thorough the implementation period within centers. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation strategy used showed moderate-to-good performance on process indicators related to adoption, reach, and implementation of the evidence-based healthy lifestyle promotion intervention in the context of routine primary care. Sources of heterogeneity and instability in these indicators may improve our understanding of factors required to attain adequate program adoption and implementation through improved implementation strategies.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Effective stakeholder engagement in research and implementation is important for improving the development and implementation of policies and programmes. A varied number of tools have been employed for stakeholder engagement. In this paper, we discuss two participatory methods for engaging with stakeholders - participatory social network analysis (PSNA) and participatory impact pathways analysis (PIPA). Based on our experience, we derive lessons about when and how to apply these tools. METHODS: This paper was informed by a review of project reports and documents in addition to reflection meetings with the researchers who applied the tools. These reports were synthesised and used to make thick descriptions of the applications of the methods while highlighting key lessons. RESULTS: PSNA and PIPA both allowed a deep understanding of how the system actors are interconnected and how they influence maternal health and maternal healthcare services. The findings from the PSNA provided guidance on how stakeholders of a health system are interconnected and how they can stimulate more positive interaction between the stakeholders by exposing existing gaps. The PIPA meeting enabled the participants to envision how they could expand their networks and resources by mentally thinking about the contributions that they could make to the project. The processes that were considered critical for successful application of the tools and achievement of outcomes included training of facilitators, language used during the facilitation, the number of times the tool is applied, length of the tools, pretesting of the tools, and use of quantitative and qualitative methods. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas both tools allowed the identification of stakeholders and provided a deeper understanding of the type of networks and dynamics within the network, PIPA had a higher potential for promoting collaboration between stakeholders, likely due to allowing interaction between them. Additionally, it was implemented within a participatory action research project. PIPA also allowed participatory evaluation of the project from the perspective of the community. This paper provides lessons about the use of these participatory tools.",

abstract="East Coast Fever (ECF) is the most economically important production disease among traditional beef cattle farmers in Zambia. Despite the disease control efforts by the government, donors, and farmers, ECF cases are increasing. Why does ECF oscillate over time? Can alternative approaches such as systems thinking contribute solutions to the complex ECF problem, avoid unintended consequences, and achieve sustainable results? To answer these research questions and inform the design and implementation of ECF interventions, we qualitatively investigated the influence of dynamic socio-economic, cultural, and ecological factors. We used system dynamics modelling to specify these dynamics qualitatively, and an innovative participatory framework called spatial group model building (SGMB). SGMB uses participatory geographical information system (GIS) concepts and techniques to capture the role of spatial phenomenon in the context of complex systems, allowing stakeholders to identify spatial phenomenon directly on physical maps and integrate such information in model development. Our SGMB process convened focus groups of beef value chain stakeholders in two distinct production systems. The focus groups helped to jointly construct a series of interrelated system dynamics models that described ECF in a broader systems context. Thus, a complementary objective of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of system dynamics modelling and SGMB in animal health. The SGMB process revealed policy leverage points in the beef cattle value chain that could be targeted to improve ECF control. For example, policies that develop sustainable and stable cattle markets and improve household income availability may have positive feedback effects on investment in animal health. The results obtained from a SGMB process also demonstrated that a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach may not be equally effective in policing ECF in different agro-ecological zones due to the complex interactions of socio-ecological context with important, and often ignored, spatial patterns.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of many interventions to promote health and prevent disease has been well established. The imperative has therefore shifted from amassing evidence about efficacy to scale-up to maximise population-level health gains. Electronic implementation monitoring, or 'e-monitoring', systems have been designed to assist and track the delivery of preventive policies and programs. However, there is little evidence on whether e-monitoring systems improve the dissemination, adoption, and ongoing delivery of evidence-based preventive programs. Also, given considerable difficulties with e-monitoring systems in the clinical sector, scholars have called for a more sophisticated re-examination of e-monitoring's role in enhancing implementation. METHODS: In the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the Population Health Information Management System (PHIMS) was created to support the dissemination of obesity prevention programs to 6000 childcare centres and elementary schools across all 15 local health districts. We have established a three-way university-policymaker-practice research partnership to investigate the impact of PHIMS on practice, how PHIMS is used, and how achievement of key performance indicators of program adoption may be associated with local contextual factors. Our methods encompass ethnographic observation, key informant interviews and participatory workshops for data interpretation at a state and local level. We use an on-line social network analysis of the collaborative relationships across local health district health promotion teams to explore the relationship between PHIMS use and the organisational structure of practice. DISCUSSION: Insights will be sensitised by institutional theory, practice theory and complex adaptive system thinking, among other theories which make sense of socio-technical action. Our working hypothesis is that the science of getting evidence-based programs into practice rests on an in-depth understanding of the role they play in the on-going system of local relationships and multiple accountabilities. Data will be synthesised to produce a typology to characterise local context, PHIMS use and key performance indicator achievement (of program implementation) across the 15 local health districts. Results could be used to continuously align e-monitoring technologies within quality improvement processes to ensure that such technologies enhance practice and innovation. A partnership approach to knowledge production increases the likelihood that findings will be put into practice.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Evidence-based decision-making is an important foundation for health policy and service planning decisions, yet there remain challenges in ensuring that the many forms of available evidence are considered when decisions are being made. Mobilising knowledge for policy and practice is an emergent process, and one that is highly relational, often messy and profoundly context dependent. Systems approaches, such as dynamic simulation modelling can be used to examine both complex health issues and the context in which they are embedded, and to develop decision support tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the novel use of participatory simulation modelling as a knowledge mobilisation tool in Australian real-world policy settings. We describe how this approach combined systems science methodology and some of the core elements of knowledge mobilisation best practice. We describe the strategies adopted in three case studies to address both technical and socio-political issues, and compile the experiential lessons derived. Finally, we consider the implications of these knowledge mobilisation case studies and provide evidence for the feasibility of this approach in policy development settings. CONCLUSION: Participatory dynamic simulation modelling builds on contemporary knowledge mobilisation approaches for health stakeholders to collaborate and explore policy and health service scenarios for priority public health topics. The participatory methods place the decision-maker at the centre of the process and embed deliberative methods and co-production of knowledge. The simulation models function as health policy and programme dynamic decision support tools that integrate diverse forms of evidence, including research evidence, expert knowledge and localised contextual information. Further research is underway to determine the impact of these methods on health service decision-making.",

abstract="OBJECTIVES: As part of a series of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded large-scale retrospective observational studies on bipolar disorder (BD) treatments and outcomes, we sought the input of patients with BD and their family members to develop research questions. We aimed to identify systemic root causes of patient-reported challenges with BD management in order to guide subsequent studies and initiatives. METHODS: Three focus groups were conducted where patients and their family members (total n = 34) formulated questions around the central theme, ``What do you wish you had known in advance or over the course of treatment for BD?'' In an affinity mapping exercise, participants clustered their questions and ranked the resulting categories by importance. The research team and members of our patient partner advisory council further rated the questions by expected impact on patients. Using a Theory of Constraints systems thinking approach, several causal models of BD management challenges and their potential solution were developed with patients using the focus group data. RESULTS: A total of 369 research questions were mapped to 33 categories revealing 10 broad themes. The top priorities for patient stakeholders involved pharmacotherapy and treatment alternatives. Analysis of causal relationships underlying 47 patient concerns revealed two core conflicts: for patients, whether or not to take pharmacotherapy, and for mental health services, the dilemma of care quality vs quantity. CONCLUSIONS: To alleviate the core conflicts identified, BD management requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach including: improved access to mental health services, objective diagnostics, sufficient provider visit time, evidence-based individualized treatment, and psychosocial support.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Obesity and non-communicable diseases are significant public health issues globally and particularly in the Pacific. Poor diet is a major contributor to this issue and policy change is a powerful lever to improve food security and diet quality. This study aims to apply systems thinking to identify the causes and consequences of poor evidence use in food-related policymaking in selected government ministries in Fiji and to illicit strategies to strengthen the use of evidence in policymaking. METHODS: The Ministry of Health and Medical Services and the Ministry of Agriculture in Fiji were invited through their respective Permanent Secretaries to participate in the study. Three 180-minute group model building (GMB) workshops were conducted separately in each ministry over three consecutive days with selected policymakers who were instrumental in developing food-related policies designed to prevent non-communicable diseases. The GMB workshops mapped the process of food-related policymaking and the contribution of scientific and local evidence to the process, and identified actions to enhance the use of evidence in policymaking. RESULTS: An average of 10 policymakers participated from each ministry. The causal loop diagrams produced by each ministry illustrated the causes and consequences of insufficient evidence use in developing food policies or precursors of the specific actions. These included (1) consultation, (2) engagement with stakeholders, (3) access and use of evidence, and (4) delays in policy processes. Participants agreed to potential leverage points on the themes above, addressing pertinent policymaker challenges in precursor control, including political influence, understanding of trade policies, competing government priorities and level of awareness on the problem. Specific actions for strengthening evidence use included training in policy development and research skills, and strengthening of coordination between ministries. CONCLUSIONS: The GMB workshops improved participants' understanding of how different parts of the policy system interact.

abstract="Insufficient capacity to use evidence-based programs (EBPs) limits the impact of community-based organizations (CBOs) to improve population health and address health disparities. PLANET MassCONECT was a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project conducted in three Massachusetts communities. Researchers and practitioners co-created an intervention to build capacity among CBO staff members to systematically find, adapt, and evaluate EBPs. The project supported development of trainee social networks and this cross-sectional study examines the association between network engagement and EBP usage, an important goal of the capacity-building program. Trainee cohorts were enrolled from June 2010 to April 2012 and we collected community-specific network data in late 2013. The relationship of interest was communication among network members regarding the systematic approach to program planning presented in the intervention. For Communities A, B, and C, 39/59, 36/61, and 50/59 trainees responded to our survey, respectively. We conducted the full network analysis in Community C. The average degree, or number of connections with other trainees, is a useful marker of engagement; respondents averaged 6.6 reported connections. Degree was associated with recent use of EBPs, in a linear regression, adjusting for important covariates. The results call for further attention to practitioner networks that support the use of research evidence in community settings. Consideration of key contextual factors, including resource levels, turnover rates, and community complexity will be vital for success.",

abstract="Consumption of raw fish is a well-documented risk factor for Opisthorchis viverrini infection. Sharing of food, especially raw fish recipes may influence the spread of disease through a community. Using social network analysis of an ego network, we investigated food sharing among households in an Opisthorchis-endemic area. Network centrality properties were used to explain the differences in O. viverrini transmission and control between villages with a low and high prevalence of infection. Information on demography and O. viverrini infection in 2008 from villagers in the Lawa Lake area was extracted from the Tropical Disease Research Center database. The two villages that had the lowest and the highest O. viverrini infection at the household level were recruited. Ten percent of households of each village were randomly sampled. Participatory epidemiology and face-to-face structured interviews guided by a social network questionnaire were used to collect data on livelihood, agricultural patterns, food sources, raw fish eating habits, and other food sharing during daily life and social gatherings. The number of contacts including in-degree and out-degree varied from 0 to 7 in the low-infection village and 0 to 4 in the high-infection village. The mean number of contacts for the food-sharing network among the low- and high-infection villages was 1.64 and 0.73 contacts per household, respectively. Between these villages, the mean number of out-degree (p=0.0125), but not in-degree (p=0.065), was significantly different. Food-sharing differed in numbers of sharing-in and sharing-out between the two villages. Network analysis of food sharing may be of value in designing strategies for opisthorchiasis control at the community level.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: Our study of informal networks aimed to explore information-sharing environments for the management of disaster medicine and public health preparedness. Understanding interagency coordination in preparing for and responding to extreme events such as disease outbreaks is central to reducing risks and coordination costs. METHODS: We evaluated the pattern of information flow for actors involved in disaster medicine through social network analysis. Social network analysis of agencies can serve as a basis for the effective design and reconstruction of disaster medicine response coordination structures. This research used new theoretical approaches in suggesting a framework and a method to study the outcome of complex inter-organizational networks in coordinating disease outbreak response. We present research surveys of 70 health professionals from different skill sets and organizational positions during the swine influenza A (H1N1) PDM09 2009 pandemic. The survey and interviews were designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data in order to build a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the dynamics of the inter-organizational networks that evolved during the pandemic. RESULTS: The degree centrality of the informal network showed a positive correlation with performance, in which the ego's performance is related to the number of links he or she establishes informally-outside the standard operating structure during the pandemic. Informal networks facilitate the transmission of both strong (ie, infections, confirmed cases, deaths in hospital or clinic settings) and weak (ie, casual acquaintances) ties. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that informal networks promoted community-based ad hoc and formal networks, thus making overall disaster medicine and public health preparedness more effective.

The broader set of systems thinking methodologies (of which GCM is one), have only recently found their way into the field. We present an overview of systems thinking emerging from a system dynamics (SD) perspective, and illustrate the potential synergy between GCM and SD. As with GCM, participatory processes are frequently employed when building SD models; however, it can be challenging to engage a large and diverse group of stakeholders in the iterative cycles of divergent thinking and consensus building required, while maintaining a broad perspective on the issue being studied. GCM provides a compelling resource for overcoming this challenge, by richly engaging a diverse set of stakeholders in broad exploration, structuring, and prioritization. SD provides an opportunity to extend GCM findings by embedding constructs in a testable hypothesis (SD model) describing how system structure and changes in constructs affect outcomes over time. SD can be used to simulate the hypothesized dynamics inherent in GCM concept maps. We illustrate the potential of the marriage of these methodologies in a case study of BECOMING, a federally-funded program aimed at strengthening the cross-sector system of care for youth with severe emotional disturbances.",

Research tools for capturing the dynamic of interventions processes, however, are practically non-existent. This paper describes the development and proof of concept process of an analytical tool, the critical event card (CEC), which supports the representation and analysis of complex interventions' evolution, based on critical events. METHODS: Drawing on the actor-network theory (ANT), we developed and field-tested the tool using three innovative health interventions in northeastern Brazil. Interventions were aimed to promote health equity through intersectoral approaches; were engaged in participatory evaluation and linked to professional training programs. The CEC developing involve practitioners and researchers from projects. Proof of concept was based on document analysis, face-to-face interviews and focus groups. RESULTS: Analytical categories from CEC allow identifying and describing critical events as milestones in the evolution of complex interventions. Categories are (1) event description; (2) actants (human and non-human) involved; (3) interactions between actants; (4) mediations performed; (5) actions performed; (6) inscriptions produced; and (7) consequences for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The CEC provides a tool to analyze and represent intersectoral internvetions' complex and dynamic evolution.",

abstract="RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Strong health systems are said to be paramount to achieving effective and equitable health care. The World Health Organization has been advocating for using system-wide approaches such as 'systems thinking' to guide intervention design and evaluation. In this paper we report the system-wide effects of a complex health system intervention in Zambia known as Better Health Outcome through Mentorship and Assessment (BHOMA) that aimed to improve service quality. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in three target districts. We used a systems thinking conceptual framework to guide the analysis focusing on intended and unintended consequences of the intervention. NVivo version 10 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The addressed community responded positively to the BHOMA intervention. The indications were that in the short term there was increased demand for services but the health worker capacity was not severely affected. This means that the prediction that service demand would increase with implementation of BHOMA was correct and the workload also increased, but the help of clinic lay supporters meant that some of the work of clinicians was transferred to these lay workers. However, from a systems perspective, unintended consequences also occurred during the implementation of the BHOMA. CONCLUSIONS: We applied an innovative approach to evaluate a complex intervention in low-income settings, exploring empirically how systems thinking can be applied in the context of health system strengthening. Although the intervention had some positive outcomes by employing system-wide approaches, we also noted unintended consequences.",

year="2016",
volume="10",
pages="25",
abstract="BACKGROUND: Afghanistan lacks suitable specialized mental healthcare services despite high prevalence of severe mental health disorders which are aggravated by the conflict and numerous daily stressors. Recent studies have shown that Afghans with mental illness are not only deprived of care but are vulnerable in many other ways. Innovative participatory approaches to the design of mental healthcare policies and programs are needed in such challenging context. METHODS: We employed community based system dynamics to examine interactions between multiple factors and actors to examine the problem of persistently low service utilization for people with mental illness. Group model building sessions, designed based on a series of scripts and led by three facilitators, took place with NGO staff members in Mazar-I-Sharif in July 2014 and in Kabul in February 2015. RESULTS: We identified major feedback loops that constitute a hypothesis of how system components interact to generate a persistently low rate of service utilization by people with mental illness. In particular, we found that the interaction of the combined burdens of poverty and cost of treatment interact with cultural and social stigmatizing beliefs, in the context of limited clinical or other treatment support, to perpetuate low access to care for people with mental disorders. These findings indicate that the introduction of mental healthcare services alone will not be sufficient to meaningfully improve the condition of individuals with mental illness if community stigma and poverty are not addressed concurrently. CONCLUSIONS: Our model highlights important factors that prevent persons with mental illness from accessing services. Our study demonstrates that group model building methods using community based system dynamics can provide an effective tool to elicit a common vision on a complex problem and identify shared potential strategies for intervention in a development and global health context. Its strength and originality is the leadership role played by the actors embedded within the system in describing the complex problem and suggesting interventions.",

This paper describes the protocol for implementing and evaluating RE-FRAME in two 'existing' (>2 years of implementation) and two 'new' Live 5-2-1-0 communities to understand how to facilitate and sustain systems/community-level change. In this mixed-methods study, RE-FRAME was implemented via online resources, webinars, a backbone organization (SCOPE) coordinating the initiative, and a linking system supporting KT. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using surveys and stakeholder interviews, analyzed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. Existing communities described the consistency of Live 5-2-1-0 and extensive local partnerships/champions as catalysts for synergistic community-wide action; new communities felt that the simplicity of the message combined with the transfer of experiential learning would inform their own strategies and policies/programs to broadly disseminate Live 5-2-1-0. RE-FRAME effectively guided the refinement of the initiative and provided a framework upon which evaluation results described how to implement a community-based systems approach to childhood obesity prevention.",

Online communities on SNS provide opportunities for bridging across groups, thus fostering the exchange of novel ideas and practices. Currently, there have only been limited efforts to examine SNS within the context of youth-led efforts. To explore the potential of SNS to facilitate the diffusion of social justice efforts between distinct youth groups, we linked three school-based youth-led participatory action research projects involving 54 high school students through a SNS. This study offers an innovative methodological approach and framework, utilizing social network analysis and strategic sampling of key student informants to investigate what individual behaviors and online network features predict student adoption of social change efforts. Findings highlight prospective facilitators and barriers to diffusion processes within a youth-led online network, as well as key constructs that may inform future research. We conclude by providing suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in examining how SNS can be used to enhance the diffusion of social justice strategies, youth-led engagement efforts, and large-scale civic organizing.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The UK government has an ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions from the housing stock through energy efficiency improvements. This single policy goal is a strong driver for change in the housing system, but comes with positive and negative ``unintended consequences'' across a broad range of outcomes for health, equity and environmental sustainability. The resulting policies are also already experiencing under-performance through a failure to consider housing as a complex system. This research aimed to move from considering disparate objectives of housing policies in isolation to mapping the links between environmental, economic, social and health outcomes as a complex system. We aimed to support a broad range of housing policy stakeholders to improve their understanding of housing as a complex system through a collaborative learning process. METHODS: We used participatory system dynamics modelling to develop a qualitative causal theory linking housing, energy and wellbeing. Qualitative interviews were followed by two interactive workshops to develop the model, involving representatives from national and local government, housing industries, non-government organisations, communities and academia. RESULTS: More than 50 stakeholders from 37 organisations participated. The process resulted in a shared understanding of wellbeing as it relates to housing; an agreed set of criteria against which to assess to future policy options; and a comprehensive set of causal loop diagrams describing the housing, energy and wellbeing system. The causal loop diagrams cover seven interconnected themes: community connection and quality of neighbourhoods; energy efficiency and climate change; fuel poverty and indoor temperature; household crowding; housing affordability; land ownership, value and development patterns; and ventilation and indoor air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The collaborative learning process and the model have been useful for shifting the thinking of a wide range of housing stakeholders towards a more integrated approach to housing. The qualitative model has begun to improve the assessment of future policy options across a broad range of outcomes. Future work is needed to validate the model and increase its utility through computer simulation incorporating best quality data and evidence. Combining system dynamics modelling with other methods for weighing up policy options, as well as methods to support shifts in the conceptual frameworks underpinning policy, will be necessary to achieve shared housing goals across physical, mental, environmental, economic and social wellbeing.",

abstract="The conservation of biodiversity today must include the participation and support of local stakeholders. Natura 2000 can be considered as a conservation system that, in its application in most EU countries, relies on the participation of local stakeholders. Our study proposes a scientific method for participatory modelling, with the aim of contributing to the conservation management of habitats and species at a Natura 2000 site (Crozon Peninsula, Bretagne, France) that is representative of in landuse changes in coastal areas. We make use of companion modelling and its associated tools (scenario-planning, GIS, multi-agent modelling and simulations) to consider possible futures through the co-construction of management scenarios and the understanding of their consequences on different indicators of biodiversity status (habitats, avifauna, flora). The maintenance of human activities as they have been carried out since the creation of the Natura 2000s zone allows the biodiversity values to remain stable. Extensive agricultural activities have been shown to be essential to this maintenance, whereas management sustained by the multiplication of conservation actions brings about variable results according to the indicators. None of the scenarios has a positive incidence on the set of indicators. However, an understanding of the modelling system and the results of the simulations allow for the refining of the selection of conservation actions in relation to the species to be preserved.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify supply-side interventions to reduce state psychiatric hospital admission delays. METHODS: Healthcare Enterprise Accounts Receivable Tracking System (HEARTS) data were collected for all patients admitted between July 1, 2010, and July 31, 2012, to one of North Carolina's three state-operated psychiatric hospitals (N=3,156). Additional information on hospital use was collected at nine meetings with hospital administrators and other local stakeholders. A discrete-event simulation model was built to simulate the flow of adult nonforensic patients through the hospital. Hypothetical scenarios were used to evaluate the effects of varying levels of increased capacity on annual number of admissions and average patient wait time prior to admission. RESULTS: In the base case, the model closely approximated actual state hospital utilization, with an average of 1,251+/-65 annual admissions and a preadmission wait time of 3.3+/-.1 days across 50 simulations. Results from simulated expansion scenarios highlighted substantial capacity shortfalls in the current system. For example, opening an additional 24-bed unit was projected to decrease average wait time by only 6{\%}. Capacity would need to be increased by 165{\%} (356 beds) to reduce average wait time below 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Without more robust community-based hospital and residential capacity, major increases in state psychiatric hospital inpatient capacity are necessary to ensure timely admission of people in crisis.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: To test a management model of facilitated reflection on network feedback as a means to engage services in problem solving the delivery of integrated primary mental healthcare to older people. DESIGN: Participatory mixed methods case study evaluating the impact of a network management model using organisational network feedback (through social network analysis, key informant interviews and policy review). INTERVENTION: A model of facilitated network reflection using network theory and methods. SETTING: A rural community in South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 32 staff from 24 services and 12 senior service managers from mental health, primary care and social care services. RESULTS: Health and social care organisations identified that they operated in clustered self-managed networks within sectors, with no overarching purposive older people's mental healthcare network. The model of facilitated reflection revealed service goal and role conflicts. These discussions helped local services to identify as a network, and begin the problem-solving communication and referral links. A Governance Group assisted this process. Barriers to integrated servicing through a network included service funding tied to performance of direct care tasks and the lack of a clear lead network administration organisation. CONCLUSIONS: A model of facilitated reflection helped organisations to identify as a network, but revealed sensitivity about organisational roles and goals, which demonstrated that conflict should be expected. Networked servicing needed a neutral network administration organisation with cross-sectoral credibility, a mandate and the resources to monitor the network, to deal with conflict, negotiate commitment among the service managers, and provide opportunities for different sectors to meet and problem solve. This requires consistency and sustained intersectoral policies that include strategies and funding to facilitate and maintain health and social care networks in rural communities.",

METHODS: Structured interviews were conducted with 39 stakeholders from three local government areas selected to represent the diversity of conflict experience across the state: Damaturu, Fune and Nguru, and with four officers of the PRRINN-MNCH program providing technical assistance for primary care development in the state. A group model building session was convened with 11 senior stakeholders, which used participatory scripts to review thematic analysis of interviews and develop a preliminary systems model linking identified variables. RESULTS: Population migration and transport restrictions have substantially impacted access to health provision. The human resource for health capability of the state has been severely diminished through the outward migration of (especially non-indigenous) health workers and the suspension of programmes providing external technical assistance. The political will of the Yobe State government to strengthen health provision - through lifting a moratorium on recruitment and providing incentives for retention and support of staff - has supported a recovery of health systems functioning. Policies of free-drug provision and decentralized drug supply appear to have been protective of the operation of the health system. Community resources and cohesion have been significant assets in combatting the impacts of the insurgency on service utilization and quality. Staff commitment and motivation - particularly amongst staff indigenous to the state - has protected health care quality and enabled flexibility of human resource deployment. CONCLUSIONS: A systems analysis using participatory group model building provided a mechanism to identify key pathways of threat and adaptation with regard to health service functioning. Generalizable systems characteristics supportive of resilience are suggested, and linked to wider discussion of the role of factors such as diversity, self-regulation and integration.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Well-designed evaluation is necessary to document the impact of farmers' markets (FMs) on health, economic, and community outcomes. However, the complex nature of FMs poses challenges for evaluation. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to describe a participatory, multilevel framework used to evaluate a FM implemented at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in a rural community in the Southeastern United States. METHODS: An iterative, collaborative process involving three feedback loops was used to engage community stakeholders in the development, implementation, and utilization of the multilevel evaluation plan. LESSONS LEARNED: A participatory approach helped to navigate the complexities of evaluating FMs and promoted stakeholder engagement. The evaluation became a core element of the intervention that informed continuous quality improvement (CQI). The development of strong university- community partnerships facilitated the ongoing use of results. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation framework presented may be used to promote community engagement and rigor for evaluation of future FMs.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The paradox of primary care is the observation that primary care is associated with apparently low levels of evidence-based care for individual diseases, but systems based on primary care have healthier populations, use fewer resources, and have less health inequality. The purpose of this article is to explore, from a complex systems perspective, mechanisms that might account for the effects of primary care beyond disease-specific care. METHODS: In an 8-session, participatory group model-building process, patient, caregiver, and primary care clinician community stakeholders worked with academic investigators to develop and refine an agent-based computer simulation model to test hypotheses about mechanisms by which features of primary care could affect health and health equity. RESULTS: In the resulting model, patients are at risk for acute illness, acute life-changing illness, chronic illness, and mental illness. Patients have changeable health behaviors and care-seeking tendencies that relate to their living in advantaged or disadvantaged neighborhoods. There are 2 types of care available to patients: primary and specialty. Primary care in the model is less effective than specialty care in treating single diseases, but it has the ability to treat multiple diseases at once. Primary care also can provide disease prevention visits, help patients improve their health behaviors, refer to specialty care, and develop relationships with patients that cause them to lower their threshold for seeking care. In a model run with primary care features turned off, primary care patients have poorer health. In a model run with all primary care features turned on, their conjoint effect leads to better population health for patients who seek primary care, with the primary care effect being particularly pronounced for patients who are disadvantaged and patients with multiple chronic conditions. Primary care leads to more total health care visits that are due to more disease prevention visits, but there are reduced illness visits among people in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Supplemental appendices provide a working version of the model and worksheets that allow readers to run their own experiments that vary model parameters. CONCLUSION: This simulation model provides insights into possible mechanisms for the paradox of primary care and shows how participatory group model building can be used to evaluate hypotheses about the behavior of such complex systems as primary health care and population health.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: Application of system thinking to the development, implementation and evaluation of childhood obesity prevention efforts represents the cutting edge of community-based prevention. We report on an approach to developing a system oriented community perspective on the causes of obesity. METHODS: Group model building sessions were conducted in a rural Australian community to address increasing childhood obesity. Stakeholders (n = 12) built a community model that progressed from connection circles to causal loop diagrams using scripts from the system dynamics literature. Participants began this work in identifying change over time in causes and effects of childhood obesity within their community. The initial causal loop diagram was then reviewed and elaborated by 50 community leaders over a full day session. RESULTS: The process created a causal loop diagram representing community perceptions of determinants and causes of obesity. The causal loop diagram can be broken down into four separate domains; social influences; fast food and junk food; participation in sport; and general physical activity. DISCUSSION: This causal loop diagram can provide the basis for community led planning of a prevention response that engages with multiple levels of existing settings and systems.",

abstract="There is an emerging and urgent need for new approaches for the management of environmental challenges such as flood hazard in the broad context of sustainability. This requires a new way of working which bridges disciplines and organisations, and that breaks down science-culture boundaries. With this, there is growing recognition that the appropriate involvement of local communities in catchment management decisions can result in multiple benefits. However, new tools are required to connect organisations and communities. The growth of cloud based technologies offers a novel way to facilitate this process of exchange of information in environmental science and management; however, stakeholders need to be engaged with as part of the development process from the beginning rather than being presented with a final product at the end. Here we present the development of a pilot Local Environmental Virtual Observatory Flooding Tool. The aim was to develop a cloud based learning platform for stakeholders, bringing together fragmented data, models and visualisation tools that will enable these stakeholders to make scientifically informed environmental management decisions at the local scale. It has been developed by engaging with different stakeholder groups in three catchment case studies in the UK and a panel of national experts in relevant topic areas. However, these case study catchments are typical of many northern latitude catchments. The tool was designed to communicate flood risk in locally impacted communities whilst engaging with landowners/farmers about the risk of runoff from the farmed landscape. It has been developed iteratively to reflect the needs, interests and capabilities of a wide range of stakeholders. The pilot tool combines cloud based services, local catchment datasets, a hydrological model and bespoke visualisation tools to explore real time hydrometric data and the impact of flood risk caused by future land use changes. The novel aspects of the pilot tool are; the co-evolution of tools on a cloud based platform with stakeholders, policy and scientists; encouraging different science disciplines to work together; a wealth of information that is accessible and understandable to a range of stakeholders; and provides a framework for how to approach the development of such a cloud based tool in the future. Above all, stakeholders saw the tool and the potential of cloud technologies as an effective means to taking a whole systems approach to solving environmental issues. This sense of community ownership is essential in order to facilitate future appropriate and acceptable land use management decisions to be co-developed by local catchment communities. The development processes and the resulting pilot tool could be applied to local catchments globally to facilitate bottom up catchment management approaches.",

abstract="Adaptive management and ecohealth frameworks were developed for malaria elimination in Amerindian riparian communities of Venezuela. These frameworks were developed as a strategy to capture, organize, and communicate connections among key factors related to local malaria complex systems. Important causal relationships between social, economic, and environmental stressors which are determinant of malaria were identified at different levels and assumptions that guide interventions are offered, based on available scientific knowledge and input from stakeholders. Drawing on our experience of action research committed to the health of Amerindian populations and conservation of areas with biodiversity value, the authors provide lessons to strengthen the practice of an ecohealth approach. First, conservation targets were considered as a way to achieve sustainable human well-being rather than as a consequence of well-being. Second, the effectiveness and sustainability of technical solutions generally proposed for malaria control depend largely on individual knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Hence, it is necessary to look at the real opportunities of choices that Amerindian people have for attaining a life without malaria, and therefore pay attention to local capabilities, needs, and freedom to choose. The ecohealth approach can benefit from the capability approach, and we explain why.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Between 2008 and 2012, the multidisciplinary Healthy Community Partnership of Columbia, Missouri, participated in a national program to address child obesity. This article describes a systems-level evaluation of their work to implement healthy eating and active living policy, system, and environmental changes to support healthier communities for children. METHODS: In 2011, the partnership participated in a Group Model Building session, consisting of 2 primary activities. First, participants sketched behavior-over-time graphs, illustrating the evolution of community variables related to child obesity, such as prevalence of walking to school or the marketing of high-sugar drinks. Later, the graphs were arranged on a large area of wall space and connections were drawn between those variables that were believed to influence each other--either positively (reinforcing connections) or negatively (opposing connections). The resulting causal loop diagram is a visual representation of the interacting systems, as perceived by the partnership. RESULTS: In reviewing the diagram, the group identified areas where they felt the diagram ``made sense'' and other areas where there were inconsistencies between the diagram and their own mental model of the processes at work. To address the inconsistencies, participants were surveyed to determine which specific modifications should be made to the diagram so it would become an accurate representation of the group's shared concept of the relevant relationships. DISCUSSION: The group felt that the final Modified causal loop diagram achieved this goal and that it provides useful insight into how their work addresses child obesity. They believe the diagram also has the potential to improve community engagement by serving as a visual model, improve planning through better resource allocation, improve implementation by identifying policy leverage points, and increase resources when used in grant applications.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Despite increased attention, conventional views of obesity are based upon individual behaviors, and children and parents living with obesity are assumed to be the primary problem solvers. Instead of focusing exclusively on individual reduction behaviors for childhood obesity, greater focus should be placed on better understanding existing community systems and their effects on obesity. The Milwaukee Childhood Obesity Prevention Project is a community-based coalition established to develop policy and environmental change strategies to impact childhood obesity in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The coalition conducted a Group Model Building exercise to better understand root causes of childhood obesity in its community. METHODS: Group Model Building is a process by which a group systematically engages in model construction to better understand the systems that are in place. It helps participants make their mental models explicit through a careful and consistent process to test assumptions. This process has 3 main components: (1) assembling a team of participants; (2) conducting a behavior-over-time graphs exercise; and (3) drawing the causal loop diagram exercise. RESULTS: The behavior-over-time graph portion produced 61 graphs in 10 categories. The causal loop diagram yielded 5 major themes and 7 subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that influence childhood obesity are varied, and it is important to recognize that no single solution exists. The perspectives from this exercise provided a means to create a process for dialogue and commitment by stakeholders and partnerships to build capacity for change within the community.",

abstract="In a previous report, the ISPOR Task Force on Dynamic Simulation Modeling Applications in Health Care Delivery Research Emerging Good Practices introduced the fundamentals of dynamic simulation modeling and identified the types of health care delivery problems for which dynamic simulation modeling can be used more effectively than other modeling methods. The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods-system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose-type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object-scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing ``volume, velocity and variety'' and availability of ``big data'' to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation.",

abstract="Within the field of water resource management, Group Model Building (GMB) is a growing method used to engage stakeholders in the development of models that describe environmental and socioeconomic systems to create and test policy alternatives. While there is significant focus on improving stakeholder engagement, there is a lack of studies specifically looking at the experiences of marginalized communities and the barriers that prevent their fuller participation in the decision-making process. This paper explores the common issues and presents recommended improved practices, based on anti-oppression, related to the stages of problem framing, stakeholder identification and selection, workshop preparation, and workshop facilitation. For problem defining and stakeholder selection, the major recommendations are to engage diverse stakeholder communities from the earliest stages and give them control over framing the project scope. With regards to planning the model building workshops, it is recommended that the facilitation team work closely with marginalized stakeholders to highlight and address barriers that would prevent their inclusion. With the actual facilitation of the workshops, it is best to employ activities that allow stakeholders to provide knowledge and input in mediums that are most comfortable to them; additionally, the facilitation team needs to be able to challenge problematic interpersonal interactions as they manifest within conversations. This article focuses on building comfortability with political language so that the systemic oppression in which existing participatory processes occur can be understood, thus allowing GMB practitioners to engage in social justice efforts.",

abstract="Over the course of the last twenty years, participatory modeling has increasingly been advocated as an integral component of integrated, adaptive, and collaborative water resources management. However, issues of high cost, time, and expertise are significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of participatory modeling in many developing countries. In this study, a step-wise method to initialize the involvement of key stakeholders in the development of qualitative system dynamics models (i.e. causal loop diagrams) is presented. The proposed approach is designed to overcome the challenges of low expertise, time and financial resources that have hampered previous participatory modeling efforts in developing countries. The methodological framework was applied in a case study of soil salinity management in the Rechna Doab region of Pakistan, with a focus on the application of qualitative modeling through stakeholder-built causal loop diagrams to address soil salinity problems in the basin. Individual causal loop diagrams were developed by key stakeholder groups, following which an overall group causal loop diagram of the entire system was built based on the individual causal loop diagrams to form a holistic qualitative model of the whole system. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach, based on using causal loop diagrams in initiating stakeholder involvement in the participatory model building process. In addition, the results point to social-economic aspects of soil salinity that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Comzmercialization of health care has contributed to widen inequities between the rich and the poor, especially in settings with suboptimal regulatory frameworks of the health sector. Poorly regulated fee-for-service payment systems generate inequity and initiate a vicious circle in which access to quality health care gradually deteriorates. Although the abolition of user fees is high on the international health policy agenda, the sudden removal of user fees may have disrupting effects on the health system and may not be affordable or sustainable in resource-constrained countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, the Belgian development aid agency (BTC) launched a set of reforms in the Kisantu district, in the province of Bas Congo, through an action-research process deemed appropriate for the implementation of change within open complex systems such as the Kisantu local health system. Moreover, the entire process contributed to strengthen the stewardship capacity of the Kisantu district management team. The reforms mainly comprised the rationalization of resources and the regulation of health services financing. Flat fees per episode of disease were introduced as an alternative to fee-for-service payments by patients. A financial subsidy from BTC allowed to reduce the height of the flat fees. The provision of the subsidy was made conditional upon a range of measures to rationalize the use of resources. CONCLUSIONS: The results in terms of enhancing people access to quality health care were immediate and substantial. The Kisantu experience demonstrates that a systems approach is essential in addressing complex problems. It provides useful lessons for other districts in the country.",

abstract="OBJECTIVES: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, genetic skin condition that is complicated, distressing, and painful and permeates every aspect of patients' lives. Support services are essential for meeting the primary needs of patients and families living with EB; however, provision is challenged by many complex issues. In collaboration with the patient organization DEBRA Ireland, this research conducted an in-depth analysis of Irish healthcare support services for EB, with a view to moving towards an improved and sustainable care pathway. METHODS: A sustainable community of practice model (SCOP), as a core construct provided a simplified framework when studying this complex system. The research utilized mixed methods, comprising individual interviews, questionnaires, and a participatory action research workshop based on a soft systems approach. The study engaged patients, family members, service providers, and policy developers. RESULTS: Findings emphasized that the complexities of life with EB are more than 'skin deep'. The lived experience of stakeholders revealed many levels of emotion, both positive and heart-rending. Despite the positive efforts of specialists in this field, inadequacies to meet the primary needs of people with EB, such as bandages-fundamental for survival-were highlighted. Participants reported challenges relating to understanding patients' needs, access to consistent services within hospitals and the community, time constraints, and the strong emotions evoked by this severe and rare disease. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified several areas that can be targeted to bring about improvements in meeting primary needs. Education and research at public, policy, and practice levels need to be prioritized. It is imperative that citizens move beyond an awareness that EB exists and demonstrate a consciousness about the importance of advocating and enabling seamless and sustainable support services through collective action.",

abstract="Rangeland-based livestock systems have to deal with the significant instability and uncertainty of the agricultural context (policy changes, volatility of input prices, etc.), and especially of the climatic context. Thus, they are particularly concerned by adaptive management strategies. To support the development of such strategies, we developed a board game including a computer model called ``Rangeland Rummy''. It is to be used by groups of farmers and agricultural consultants in the context of short workshops (about 3 h). Rangeland Rummy builds upon five types of material object: (i) a game board; (ii) a calendar stick indicating the starting date of the game board; (iii) sticks marked with the feed resources available for combinations of vegetation types and their management practices; (iv) cards to define animal groups and their feeding requirements throughout the year; (v) cards related to types of feed that can be attributed to animal groups throughout the year. Using these material objects, farmers collectively design a rangeland-based livestock system. This system is immediately evaluated using a computer model, i.e. a spreadsheet providing graphs and indicators providing information on, among other things, the extent to which quantitative and qualitative animal feeding requirements are covered across the year. Playing the game thus consists in collectively and iteratively designing and evaluating rangeland-based livestock systems, while confronting the players with new contextual challenges (e.g. interannual variability of weather, volatility of input prices) or new farmers' objectives (e.g. being self-sufficient for animal feeding). An example of application of Rangeland Rummy with 3 farmers in southern France is reported. Applications show that it tends to develop farmers' adaptive capacity by stimulating their discussions and the exchange of locally-relevant knowledge on management strategies and practices in rangeland-based livestock systems.",

abstract="End-of-life caring is often associated with reduced social networks for both the dying person and for the carer. However, those adopting a community participation and development approach, see the potential for the expansion and strengthening of networks. This paper uses Knox, Savage and Harvey's definitions of three generations social network analysis to analyse the caring networks of people with a terminal illness who are being cared for at home and identifies changes in these caring networks that occurred over the period of caring. Participatory network mapping of initial and current networks was used in nine focus groups. The analysis used key concepts from social network analysis (size, density, transitivity, betweenness and local clustering) together with qualitative analyses of the group's reflections on the maps. The results showed an increase in the size of the networks and that ties between the original members of the network strengthened. The qualitative data revealed the importance between core and peripheral network members and the diverse contributions of the network members. The research supports the value of third generation social network analysis and the potential for end-of-life caring to build social capital.",

Little is known about measuring partnership in implementing public health strategies. We collected data from 23 Missouri communities in early 2012 that received funding from three separate programs to prevent obesity and/or reduce tobacco use. While all of these funding programs encourage partnership, only the Social Innovation for Missouri (SIM) program included a focus on building community capacity and enhancing collaboration. Social network analysis techniques were used to understand contact and collaboration networks in community organizations. Measurements of average degree, density, degree centralization, and betweenness centralization were calculated for each network. Because of the various sizes of the networks, we conducted comparative analyses with and without adjustment for network size. SIM programs had increased measurements of average degree for partner collaboration and larger networks. When controlling for network size, SIM groups had higher measures of network density and lower measures of degree centralization and betweenness centralization. SIM collaboration networks were more dense and less centralized, indicating increased partnership. The methods described in this paper can be used to compare partnership in community networks of various sizes. Further research is necessary to define causal mechanisms of partnership development and their relationship to public health outcomes.",

abstract="In Malawi, where the majority of the population resides in rural areas, community health workers (CHWs) are the first, and often only, providers of health services. An assessment of health information needs, however, found that these frontline workers often lacked essential health information. A pilot project, implemented in 2 rural districts of Malawi between 2010 and 2011, introduced a mobile phone system to strengthen knowledge exchange within networks of CHWs and district staff. To evaluate the mobile phone intervention, a participatory evaluation method called Net-Map was used, an approach built on traditional social network analysis. Together, CHWs and district personnel discussed information needs and gaps and the roles of different actors in their information networks. They then used drawings and 3-dimensional objects to create baseline and endline maps showing the linkages and levels of influence among members of the information network. Net-Map provided them with powerful evidence of differences before and after the mobile phone initiative. At baseline, CHWs were not mentioned as actors in the information network, while at endline they were seen to have significant connections with colleagues, beneficiaries, supervisors, and district health facilities, as both recipients and providers of information. Focus groups with CHWs complemented the Net-Map findings with reports of increased self-confidence and greater trust by their communities. These qualitative results were bolstered by surveys that showed decreases in stockouts of essential medicines, lower communication costs, wider service coverage, and more efficient referrals. As an innovative, participatory form of social network analysis, Net-Map yielded important visual, quantitative, and qualitative information at reasonable cost.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Starting in 1999, Concern Worldwide Inc. (Concern) worked with two Bangladeshi municipal health departments to support delivery of maternal and child health preventive services. A mid-term evaluation identified sustainability challenges. Concern relied on systems thinking implicitly to re-prioritize sustainability, but stakeholders also required a method, an explicit set of processes, to guide their decisions and choices during and after the project. METHODS: Concern chose the Sustainability Framework method to generate creative thinking from stakeholders, create a common vision, and monitor progress. The Framework is based on participatory and iterative steps: defining (mapping) the local system and articulating a long-term vision, describing scenarios for achieving the vision, defining the elements of the model, and selecting corresponding indicators, setting and executing an assessment plan,, and repeated stakeholder engagement in analysis and decisions . Formal assessments took place up to 5 years post-project (2009). RESULTS: Strategic choices for the project were guided by articulating a collective vision for sustainable health, mapping the system of actors required to effect and sustain change, and defining different components of analysis. Municipal authorities oriented health teams toward equity-oriented service delivery efforts, strengthening of the functionality of Ward Health Committees, resource leveraging between municipalities and the Ministry of Health, and mitigation of contextual risks. Regular reference to a vision (and set of metrics (population health, organizational and community capacity) mitigated political factors. Key structures and processes were maintained following elections and political changes. Post-project achievements included the maintenance or improvement 5 years post-project (2009) in 9 of the 11 health indicator gains realized during the project (1999-2004). Some elements of performance and capacity weakened, but reductions in the equity gap achieved during the project were largely maintained post-project. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainability is dynamic and results from local systems processes, which can be strengthened through both implicit and explicit systems thinking steps applied with constancy of purpose.",

abstract="Bushmeat management policies are often developed outside the communities in which they are to be implemented. These policies are also routinely designed to be applied uniformly across communities with little regard for variation in social or ecological conditions. We used fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, a form of participatory modeling, to compare the assumptions driving externally generated bushmeat management policies with perceptions of bushmeat trade dynamics collected from local community members who admitted to being recently engaged in bushmeat trading (e.g., hunters, sellers, consumers). Data were collected during 9 workshops in 4 Tanzanian villages bordering Serengeti National Park. Specifically, we evaluated 9 community-generated models for the presence of the central factors that comprise and drive the bushmeat trade and whether or not models included the same core concepts, relationships, and logical chains of reasoning on which bushmeat conservation policies are commonly based. Across local communities, there was agreement about the most central factors important to understanding the bushmeat trade (e.g., animal recruitment, low income, and scarcity of food crops). These matched policy assumptions. However, the factors perceived to drive social-ecological bushmeat trade dynamics were more diverse and varied considerably across communities (e.g., presence or absence of collaborative law enforcement, increasing human population, market demand, cultural preference). Sensitive conservation issues, such as the bushmeat trade, that require cooperation between communities and outside conservation organizations can benefit from participatory modeling approaches that make local-scale dynamics and conservation policy assumptions explicit. Further, communities' and conservation organizations' perceptions need to be aligned. This can improve success by allowing context appropriate policies to be developed, monitored, and appropriately adapted as new evidence is generated.",

Drawing on interviews with lead organization staff, participant observation field notes, network mapping and analysis of documents and artifacts from the initiative, we analyze the local organizational context and illuminate important processes associated with supporting a developing coalition. Findings offer a picture of the interorganizational relationships in the community using social network analysis and identify the organizational capacity factors that contribute to and inhibit the formation of a cohesive and effective coalition in this context. This study also highlights the utility of an action research approach to organizational learning about coalition-building in such a way that informs decision making.",

abstract="Madagascar's 36.5-million-head poultry industry holds a foremost place in its economy and the livelihood of its people. Unfortunately, regular Newcastle disease outbreaks associated with high mortality causes high losses for smallholders and threatens their livelihood. Therefore, Madagascar is seeking concrete, achievable and sustainable methods for the surveillance and the control of Newcastle disease. In this paper, we present and analyze the results of a field study conducted in Madagascar between December 2009 and December 2010. The study area was the Lac Alaotra region, a landlocked area in the north-eastern part of the country's center. Poultry trading is suspected of playing a major role in the spread of avian diseases, especially in developing countries characterized by many live-bird markets and middlemen. Therefore, the goals of our study were to: (i) describe and analyze smallholders' poultry trading network in the Lake Alaotra region using social network analysis; (ii) assess the role of the network in the spread of Newcastle disease; and (iii) propose the implementation of a targeted disease surveillance based on the characteristics of the poultry trading network. We focused our field study on the harvesting of two data sets. The first is a complete description of the poultry trading network in the landlocked area of Lac Alaotra, including a description of the poultry movements between groups of villages. The second set of data measures the occurrence of outbreaks in the same area by combining a participatory approach with an event-based surveillance method. These data were used to determine the attributes of the network, and to statistically assess the association between the position of nodes and the occurrence of outbreaks. By using social network analysis techniques combined with a classification method and a logistic model, we finally identified 3 nodes (set of villages), of the 387 in the initial network, to focus on for surveillance and control in the Lac Alaotra area. This result is of primary importance in the ongoing efforts to effectively improve the wellbeing of people in the region.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Shifting to active modes of transport in the trip to work can achieve substantial co-benefits for health, social equity, and climate change mitigation. Previous integrated modeling of transport scenarios has assumed active transport mode share and has been unable to incorporate acknowledged system feedbacks. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of policies to increase bicycle commuting in a car-dominated city and explored the role of participatory modeling to support transport planning in the face of complexity. METHODS: We used system dynamics modeling (SDM) to compare realistic policies, incorporating feedback effects, nonlinear relationships, and time delays between variables. We developed a system dynamics model of commuter bicycling through interviews and workshops with policy, community, and academic stakeholders. We incorporated best available evidence to simulate five policy scenarios over the next 40 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Injury, physical activity, fuel costs, air pollution, and carbon emissions outcomes were simulated. RESULTS: Using the simulation model, we demonstrated the kinds of policies that would likely be needed to change a historical pattern of decline in cycling into a pattern of growth that would meet policy goals. Our model projections suggest that transforming urban roads over the next 40 years, using best practice physical separation on main roads and bicycle-friendly speed reduction on local streets, would yield benefits 10-25 times greater than costs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first integrated simulation model of future specific bicycling policies. Our projections provide practical evidence that may be used by health and transport policy makers to optimize the benefits of transport bicycling while minimizing negative consequences in a cost-effective manner. The modeling process enhanced understanding by a range of stakeholders of cycling as a complex system. Participatory SDM can be a helpful method for integrating health and environmental outcomes in transport and urban planning.",

abstract="The concept of a ``social license to operate'' (SLO) was coined in the 1990s and gained popularity as one way in which ``social'' considerations can be addressed in mineral development decision making. The need for a SLO implies that developers require the widespread approval of local community members for their projects to avoid exposure to potentially costly conflict and business risks. Only a limited amount of scholarship exists on the topic, and there is a need for research that specifically addresses the complex and changeable nature of SLO outcomes. In response to these challenges, this paper advances a novel, systems-based conceptual framework for assessing SLO determinants and outcomes in the mining industry. Two strands of systems theory are specifically highlighted-complex adaptive systems and resilience-and the roles of context, key system variables, emergence, change, uncertainty, feedbacks, cross-scale effects, multiple stable states, thresholds, and resilience are discussed. The framework was developed from the results of a multi-year research project which involved international mining case study investigations, a comprehensive literature review, and interviews conducted with mining stakeholders and observers. The framework can help guide SLO analysis and management efforts, by encouraging users to account for important contextual and complexity-oriented elements present in SLO settings. We apply the framework to a case study in Alaska, USA before discussing its merits and challenges. We also illustrate knowledge gaps associated with applications of complex adaptive systems and resilience theories to the study of SLO dynamics, and discuss opportunities for future research.",

abstract="This article describes a process for integrating health behavior and social science theories with practice-based insights using participatory systems thinking and diagramming methods largely inspired by system dynamics methods. This integration can help close the gap between research and practice in health education and health behavior by offering a systematic approach to bring together stakeholders across multiple domains. In this process we create a diagram using constructs from multiple health behavior theories at all levels of the social ecological framework as variables in causal loop diagrams. The goal of this process is to elucidate the reciprocal relationships between explanatory factors at various levels of the social ecological framework that render so many public health problems intractable. To illustrate, we detail a theory-based, replicable process for creating a qualitative diagram to enrich understanding of caregiver and provider behavior around adherence to pediatric asthma action plans. We describe how such diagramming can serve as the foundation for translating evidence into practice to address real-world challenges. Key insights gained include recognition of the complex, multilevel factors affecting whether, and how effectively, parents/caregivers and medical providers co-create an asthma action plan, and important ``feedback'' dynamics at play that can support or derail ongoing collaboration. Although this article applies this method to asthma action plan adherence in children, the method and resulting diagrams are applicable and adaptable to other health behaviors requiring continuous, daily action.",

Such simple models provide thinking tools which can be used for discussion and exploration of complex issues, as well as sense checking the implications of suggested causal links. They increase stakeholder motivation and understanding of whole systems approaches, but cannot be separated from an intersubjective participatory context. Standard FCM methodologies make simplifying assumptions, which may strongly influence results, presenting particular challenges and opportunities.

It is informed by those frameworks but differs insofar as it puts more emphasis on a constructivist conception which recognises that sustainability needs to be defined anew for each planning problem. In finding such a consensus definition, POSAF uses participatory scenario analysis and participatory planning, technical feasibility study, participatory assessment, analysis of trade-offs and social networks in an unusual combination and for goals that differ from the original conceptions of these methods. POSAF was applied in a peri-urban area of Mexico City for the design of improved water service provision, integrating solid waste management. It supported consensus amongst users about the importance of environmental issues, informed planners about the values of stakeholders and users, detected local differences, and identified possible conflicts at an early stage of decision-making.",

abstract="A participatory modelling process has been conducted in two areas of the Guadiana river (the upper and the middle sub-basins), in Spain, with the aim of providing support for decision making in the water management field. The area has a semi-arid climate where irrigated agriculture plays a key role in the economic development of the region and accounts for around 90{\%} of water use. Following the guidelines of the European Water Framework Directive, we promote stakeholder involvement in water management with the aim to achieve an improved understanding of the water system and to encourage the exchange of knowledge and views between stakeholders in order to help building a shared vision of the system. At the same time, the resulting models, which integrate the different sectors and views, provide some insight of the impacts that different management options and possible future scenarios could have. The methodology is based on a Bayesian network combined with an economic model and, in the middle Guadiana sub-basin, with a crop model. The resulting integrated modelling framework is used to simulate possible water policy, market and climate scenarios to find out the impacts of those scenarios on farm income and on the environment. At the end of the modelling process, an evaluation questionnaire was filled by participants in both sub-basins.",

abstract="Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) aims at finding practical and sustainable solutions to water resource issues. Research and practice have shown that innovative methods and tools are not sufficient to implement IWRM - the concept needs to also be integrated in prevailing management paradigms and institutions. Water governance science addresses this human dimension by focusing on the analysis of regulatory processes that influence the behavior of actors in water management systems. This paper proposes a new methodology for the integrated analysis of water resources management and governance systems in order to elicit and analyze case-specific management paradigms. It builds on the Management and Transition Framework (MTF) that allows for the examination of structures and processes underlying water management and governance. The new methodology presented in this paper combines participatory modeling and analysis of the governance system by using the MTF to investigate case-specific management paradigms. The linking of participatory modeling and research on complex management and governance systems allows for the transfer of knowledge between scientific, policy, engineering and local communities. In this way, the proposed methodology facilitates assessment and implementation of transformation processes towards IWRM that require also the adoption of adaptive management principles. A case study on flood management in the Tisza River Basin in Hungary is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.",

abstract="Environmental policy and decision-making are characterized by complex interactions between different actors and sectors. As a rule, a stakeholder analysis is performed to understand those involved, but it has been criticized for lacking quality and consistency. This lack is remedied here by a formal social network analysis that investigates collaborative and multi-level governance settings in a rigorous way. We examine the added value of combining both elements. Our case study examines infrastructure planning in the Swiss water sector. Water supply and wastewater infrastructures are planned far into the future, usually on the basis of projections of past boundary conditions. They affect many actors, including the population, and are expensive. In view of increasing future dynamics and climate change, a more participatory and long-term planning approach is required. Our specific aims are to investigate fragmentation in water infrastructure planning, to understand how actors from different decision levels and sectors are represented, and which interests they follow. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders, but also cantonal and national actors. The network analysis confirmed our hypothesis of strong fragmentation: we found little collaboration between the water supply and wastewater sector (confirming horizontal fragmentation), and few ties between local, cantonal, and national actors (confirming vertical fragmentation). Infrastructure planning is clearly dominated by engineers and local authorities. Little importance is placed on longer-term strategic objectives and integrated catchment planning, but this was perceived as more important in a second analysis going beyond typical questions of stakeholder analysis. We conclude that linking a stakeholder analysis, comprising rarely asked questions, with a rigorous social network analysis is very fruitful and generates complementary results. This combination gave us deeper insight into the socio-political-engineering world of water infrastructure planning that is of vital importance to our well-being.",

abstract="A participatory Bayesian approach was used to investigate how the views of stakeholders could be utilized to develop models to help understand the Central Baltic herring fishery. In task one, we applied the Bayesian belief network methodology to elicit the causal assumptions of six stakeholders on factors that influence natural mortality, growth, and egg survival of the herring stock in probabilistic terms. We also integrated the expressed views into a meta-model using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. In task two, we used influence diagrams to study qualitatively how the stakeholders frame the management problem of the herring fishery and elucidate what kind of causalities the different views involve. The paper combines these two tasks to assess the suitability of the methodological choices to participatory modeling in terms of both a modeling tool and participation mode. The paper also assesses the potential of the study to contribute to the development of participatory modeling practices. It is concluded that the subjective perspective to knowledge, that is fundamental in Bayesian theory, suits participatory modeling better than a positivist paradigm that seeks the objective truth. The methodology provides a flexible tool that can be adapted to different kinds of needs and challenges of participatory modeling. The ability of the approach to deal with small data sets makes it cost-effective in participatory contexts. However, the BMA methodology used in modeling the biological uncertainties is so complex that it needs further development before it can be introduced to wider use in participatory contexts.",

abstract="AIM: This case study describes how broker organizations supported a network of community-based services to work together to address the primary healthcare needs of recent immigrant families with young children. BACKGROUND: In parts of Canada with low levels of immigration compared with large urban centres, service providers may need to collaborate more closely with one another so that cultural competencies and resources are shared. Providers within Atlantic Canada, with its relatively small immigrant population, were faced with such a challenge. METHODS: Social network analysis and qualitative inquiry were the methods used within this case study. Twenty-seven organizations and four proxy organizations representing other organization types were identified as part of the network serving a geographically bounded neighbourhood within a mid-sized urban centre in Atlantic Canada in 2009. Twenty-one of the 27 organizations participated in the network survey and 14 key informants from the service community were interviewed. Findings Broker organizations were identified as pivotal for ensuring connections among network members, for supporting immigrant family access to services through their involvement with multiple providers, and for developing cultural competence capacities in the system overall. Network cohesiveness differed depending on the type of need being addressed, as did the organizations playing the role of broker. Service providers were able to extend their reach through the co-location of services in local centres and schools attended by immigrant families and their children. The study demonstrates the value of ties across service sectors facilitated by broker organizations to ensure the delivery of comprehensive services to young immigrant families challenged by an unfamiliar system of care.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Emerging eHealth tools could facilitate the delivery of comprehensive care in time-constrained clinical settings. One such tool is interactive computer-assisted health-risk assessments (HRA), which may improve provider-patient communication at the point of care, particularly for psychosocial health concerns, which remain under-detected in clinical encounters. The research team explored the perspectives of healthcare providers representing a variety of disciplines (physicians, nurses, social workers, allied staff) regarding the factors required for implementation of an interactive HRA on psychosocial health. METHODS: The research team employed a semi-qualitative participatory method known as Concept Mapping, which involved three distinct phases. First, in face-to-face and online brainstorming sessions, participants responded to an open-ended central question: ``What factors should be in place within your clinical setting to support an effective computer-assisted screening tool for psychosocial risks?'' The brainstormed items were consolidated by the research team. Then, in face-to-face and online sorting sessions, participants grouped the items thematically as 'it made sense to them'. Participants also rated each item on a 5-point scale for its 'importance' and 'action feasibility' over the ensuing six month period. The sorted and rated data was analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses which produced visual maps. In the third and final phase, the face-to-face Interpretation sessions, the concept maps were discussed and illuminated by participants collectively. RESULTS: Overall, 54 providers participated (emergency care 48{\%}; primary care 52{\%}). Participants brainstormed 196 items thought to be necessary for the implementation of an interactive HRA emphasizing psychosocial health. These were consolidated by the research team into 85 items. After sorting and rating, cluster analysis revealed a concept map with a seven-cluster solution: 1) the HRA's equitable availability; 2) the HRA's ease of use and appropriateness; 3) the content of the HRA survey; 4) patient confidentiality and choice; 5) patient comfort through humanistic touch; 6) professional development, care and workload; and 7) clinical management protocol. Drawing insight from the theoretical lens of Sociotechnical theory, the seven clusters of factors required for HRA implementation could be read as belonging to three overarching aspects : Technical (cluster 1, 2 and 3), Social-Patient (cluster 4 and 5), and Social-Provider (cluster 6 and 7). Participants rated every one of the clusters as important, with mean scores from 4.0 to 4.5. Their scores for feasibility were somewhat lower, ranging from 3.4 to. 4.3. Comparing the scores for importance and feasibility, a significant difference was found for one cluster from each region (cluster 2, 5, 6). The cluster on professional development, care and workload was perceived as especially challenging in emergency department settings, and possible reasons were discussed in the interpretation sessions. CONCLUSION: A number of intertwined multilevel factors emerged as important for the implementation of a computer-assisted, interactive HRA with a focus on psychosocial health. Future developments in this area could benefit from systems thinking and insights from theoretical perspectives, such as sociotechnical system theory for joint optimization and responsible autonomy, with emphasis on both the technical and social aspects of HRA implementation.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The US Institute of Medicine has recommended an integrated, locally sensitive collaboration among the various members of the community, health care systems, and research organizations to improve dementia care and dementia research. METHODS: Using complex adaptive system theory and reflective adaptive process, we developed a professional network called the ``Indianapolis Discovery Network for Dementia'' (IDND). The IDND facilitates effective and sustainable interactions among a local and diverse group of dementia researchers, clinical providers, and community advocates interested in improving care for dementia patients in Indianapolis, Indiana. RESULTS: The IDND was established in February 2006 and now includes more than 250 members from more than 30 local (central Indiana) organizations representing 20 disciplines. The network uses two types of communication to connect its members. The first is a 2-hour face-to-face bimonthly meeting open to all members. The second is a web-based resource center (http://www.indydiscoverynetwork.org ). To date, the network has: (1) accomplished the development of a network website with an annual average of 12,711 hits per day; (2) produced clinical tools such as the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor and the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale; (3) translated and implemented the collaborative dementia care model into two local health care systems; (4) created web-based tracking software, the Enhanced Medical Record for Aging Brain Care (eMR-ABC), to support care coordination for patients with dementia; (5) received more than USD{\$}24 million in funding for members for dementia-related research studies; and (6) adopted a new group-based problem-solving process called the ``IDND consultancy round.'' CONCLUSION: A local interdisciplinary ``think-tank'' network focused on dementia that promotes collaboration in research projects, educational initiatives, and quality improvement efforts that meet the local research, clinical, and community needs relevant to dementia care has been built.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: While participatory social network analysis can help health service partnerships to solve problems, little is known about its acceptability in cross-cultural settings. We conducted two case studies of chronic illness service partnerships in 2007 and 2008 to determine whether participatory research incorporating social network analysis is acceptable for problem-solving in Australian Aboriginal health service delivery. METHODS: Local research groups comprising 13-19 partnership staff, policy officers and community members were established at each of two sites to guide the research and to reflect and act on the findings. Network and work practice surveys were conducted with 42 staff, and the results were fed back to the research groups. At the end of the project, 19 informants at the two sites were interviewed, and the researchers conducted critical reflection. The effectiveness and acceptability of the participatory social network method were determined quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS: Participants in both local research groups considered that the network survey had accurately described the links between workers related to the exchange of clinical and cultural information, team care relationships, involvement in service management and planning and involvement in policy development. This revealed the function of the teams and the roles of workers in each partnership. Aboriginal workers had a high number of direct links in the exchange of cultural information, illustrating their role as the cultural resource, whereas they had fewer direct links with other network members on clinical information exchange and team care. The problem of their current and future roles was discussed inside and outside the local research groups. According to the interview informants the participatory network analysis had opened the way for problem-solving by ``putting issues on the table''. While there were confronting and ethically challenging aspects, these informants considered that with flexibility of data collection to account for the preferences of Aboriginal members, then the method was appropriate in cross-cultural contexts for the difficult discussions that are needed to improve partnerships. CONCLUSION: Critical reflection showed that the preconditions for difficult discussions are, first, that partners have the capacity to engage in such discussions, second, that partners assess whether the effort required for these discussions is balanced by the benefits they gain from the partnership, and, third, that ``boundary spanning'' staff can facilitate commitment to partnership goals.",

Systems science refers to a field of study that posits a holistic framework that is focused on component parts of a system in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems. Systems thinking tools can assist in intervention planning by allowing all CBPR stakeholders to visualize how community factors are interrelated and by potentially identifying the most salient intervention points. To demonstrate the potential utility of systems science tools in CBPR, the authors show the use of causal loop diagrams by a community coalition engaged in CBPR activities regarding youth drinking reduction and prevention.",

abstract="Community mobilization and collaboration among diverse partners are vital components of the effort to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities in the United States. We studied the development and impact of intersectoral connections among the members of the Massachusetts Community Network for Cancer Education, Research, and Training (MassCONECT). As one of the Community Network Program sites funded by the National Cancer Institute, this infrastructure-building initiative utilized principles of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) to unite community coalitions, researchers, policymakers, and other important stakeholders to address cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester. We conducted a cross-sectional, sociometric network analysis four years after the network was formed. A total of 38 of 55 members participated in the study (69{\%} response rate). Over four years of collaboration, the number of intersectoral connections reported by members (intersectoral out-degree) increased, as did the extent to which such connections were reported reciprocally (intersectoral reciprocity). We assessed relationships between these markers of intersectoral collaboration and three intermediate outcomes in the effort to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities: delivery of community activities, policy engagement, and grants/publications. We found a positive and statistically significant relationship between intersectoral out-degree and community activities and policy engagement (the relationship was borderline significant for grants/publications). We found a positive and statistically significant relationship between intersectoral reciprocity and community activities and grants/publications (the relationship was borderline significant for policy engagement). The study suggests that intersectoral connections may be important drivers of diverse intermediate outcomes in the effort to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities. The findings support investment in infrastructure-building and intersectoral mobilization in addressing disparities and highlight the benefits of using CBPR approaches for such work.",

abstract="The formulation and communication of fish advisories are highly complex because of the potential conflict between the nutritional and toxicological issues associated with fish consumption. Government and organization-sponsored fish advisories have had limited success in changing behaviors. Participatory approaches may enhance the understanding of complex issues and the adoption of new behaviors. Here we used social network analysis to investigate the adoption of dietary changes within the context of a community participatory research project. In the Brazilian Amazon, many communities are highly exposed to methylmercury from fish consumption. A participatory intervention based on dietary changes aimed at reducing methylmercury exposure while maintaining fish consumption was initiated in 1995. In 2001, we collected data on individual participation in the research, on the discussion network regarding mercury issues and on changes in fish consumption from 96 of the 110 village households. More than half of men and women had adopted new fish consumption behavior to reduce mercury exposure. Adoption was associated with participation in the research project for both women and men, and with a higher number of discussion partners about mercury issues for women. Adoption was likewise associated with the presence of a female communication partner in the personal networks of both men and women. At the household level, men and women who considered their spouse as a discussion partner were more likely to adopt than those who did not. Opinion le]adership was associated with change in fish consumption only for women. We discuss the contribution of community participation and communication networks to overcome the difficulties in generating complex messages that take into account both health benefits and risks of fish consumption. We also discuss the relevance of building preventive health programs based on participatory research approaches and the roles and relations specific to men and women.",

abstract="The Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) is one of the Community Network Program sites funded (2005-10) by the National Cancer Institute's Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. TBCCN was tasked to form a sustainable, community-based partnership network focused on the goal of reducing cancer health disparities among racial-ethnic minority and medically underserved populations. This article reports evaluation outcome results from a social network analysis and discusses the varying TBCCN partner roles-in education, training, and research-over a span of three years (2007-09). The network analysis included 20 local community partner organizations covering a tricounty area in Southwest Florida. In addition, multiple externally funded, community-based participatory research pilot projects with community-academic partners have either been completed or are currently in progress, covering research topics including culturally targeted colorectal and prostate cancer screening education, patient navigation focused on preventing cervical cancer in rural Latinas, and community perceptions of biobanking. The social network analysis identified a trend toward increased network decentralization based on betweenness centrality and overall increase in number of linkages, suggesting network sustainability. Degree centrality, trust, and multiplexity exhibited stability over the three-year time period. These results suggest increased interaction and interdependence among partner organizations and less dependence on the cancer center. Social network analysis enabled us to quantitatively evaluate partnership network functioning of TBCCN in terms of network structure and information and resources flows, which are integral to understanding effective coalition practice based on Community Coalition Action Theory ( Butterfoss and Kegler 2009). Sharing the results of the social network analysis with the partnership network is an important component of our coalition building efforts. A comprehensive baseline needs assessment for the next five-year funding phase (2010-15) of TBCCN Community Networks Program Centers (CNP Center) is under way to further evaluate the growth and sustainability of the partnership network, with an emphasis on community-based intervention research that takes into account culture and literacy.

abstract="ISSUES ADDRESSED: This paper provides a model for how health promotion teams might establish and support regional collaborations of organisations in a broad response to climate change that enables emergence of multiple strategies tailored to regional needs. METHODS: Complex Adaptive Systems Theory (CAS) and Organisational Learning informed action to foster a Climate Change Collaboration that engaged in strategies to improve transport options, food security and energy sustainability. Social Network Analysis was used to evaluate the degree to which member organisations became networked, the evolution of key network qualities and the way the organisations were affiliated via their participation in emergent strategies. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2009 a highly connected network of organisations emerged and rapidly evolved to collaborate for action on climate change. There were significant improvements in network density, centralisation, clustering and reciprocity. Member organisations collaborated on a broad range of strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing regional impact of climate change is complex. It requires long-term collaboration between organisations that may not usually work together. Sustain Northern Rivers provides a successful model for achieving such collaboration.",

abstract="The Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) is one of 25 Community Network Programs funded by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities with the objectives to create a collaborative infrastructure of academic and community based organizations and to develop effective and sustainable interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. In order to describe the network characteristics of the TBCCN as part of our ongoing evaluation efforts, we conducted social network analysis surveys with our community partners in 2007 and 2008. One key finding showed that the mean trust value for the 20 community partners in the study increased from 1.8 to 2.1 (p<0.01), suggesting a trend toward increased trust in the network. These preliminary results suggest that TBCCN has led to greater collaboration among the community partners that were formed through its capacity-building and evidence-based dissemination activities for impacting cancer health disparities at the community level.",

abstract="OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether a community-based initiative designed to reduce cancer disparities among Pacific Islanders in Southern California increased communications between community-based organizations and university researchers. METHODS: We conducted network analysis among 11 community-based organizations (CBOs) and 5 universities by interviewing 91 and 56 members of these organizations, respectively, at 2 points in time. We estimated random effects probit regression and stochastic actor-oriented network dynamic models. RESULTS: We found that, during the 2-year study period, CBOs increased their connectedness with one another (b= 0.44; P < .05) and to the universities (b = 0.46; P < .05), but that university researchers did not increase their connectedness to each other or to CBOs. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer awareness, cancer education, and access to cancer services are low among Pacific Island groups, and this study provides an initial attempt to reduce these disparities. Community-based initiatives can strengthen a CBO network, creating the potential for increased community-informed cancer research and improved community access to cancer research resources.",

abstract="CONTEXT: Four maternity/obstetrical care organizations, representing women, midwives, obstetricians and family doctors conducted interdisciplinary policy research under auspices of four key stakeholder groups. These projects teams and key stakeholders subsequently collaborated to develop consensus on strategies for improved maternity services in Ontario. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to evaluate a 2-day research synthesis and consensus building conference to answer policy questions in relation to new models of interdisciplinary maternity care organizations in different settings in Ontario. METHODS: The evaluation consisted of a scan of individual project activities and findings as were presented to an invited audience of key stakeholders at the consensus conference. This involved: participant observation with key informant consultation; a survey of attendees; pattern processing and sense making of project materials, consensus statements derived at the conference in the light of participant observation and survey material as pertaining to a complex system. The development of a systems framework for maternity care policy in Ontario was based on secondary analysis of the material. FINDINGS: Conference participants were united on the importance of investment in maternity care for Ontario and the impending workforce crisis if adaptation of the workforce did not take place. The conference participants proposed reforming the current system that was seen as too rigid and inflexible in relation to the constraints of legislation, provider scope of practice and remuneration issues. However, not one model of interdisciplinary maternity/obstetrical care was endorsed. Consistency and coherence of models (rather than central standardization) through self-organization based on local needs was strongly endorsed. An understanding of primary maternity care models as subsystems of networked providers in complex health organizations and a wider social system emerged. The patterns identified were incorporated into a complexity framework to assist sense making to inform policy. DISCUSSION: Coherence around core values, holism and synthesis with responsiveness to local needs and key stakeholders were themes that emerged consistent with complex adaptive systems principles. Respecting historical provider relationships and local history provided a background for change recognizing that systems evolve in part from where they have been. The building of functioning relationships was central through education and improved communication with ongoing feedback loops (positive and negative). Information systems and a flexible improved central and local organization of maternity services was endorsed. Education and improved communication through ongoing feedback loops (positive and negative) were central to building functioning relationships. Also, coordinated central organization with a flexible and adaptive local organization of maternity services was endorsed by participants. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation used an approach comprising scoping, pattern processing and sense making. While the projects produced considerable typical research evidence, the key policy questions could not be addressed by this alone, and a process of synthesis and consensus building with stakeholder engagement was applied. An adaptive system with local needs driving a relationship based network of interdisciplinary groupings or teams with both bottom up and central leadership. A complexity framework enhanced sense making for the system approaches and understandings that emerged.",

abstract="Reducing health inequalities has been part of the New Zealand government's agenda since the early 1990s. As a result, interventions have been implemented nationally with the explicit goal of reducing health inequalities. This paper describes findings from a comparative case study of two community-based interventions - carried out in different New Zealand communities. Complexity theory was used as an analytic tool to examine the case data, and provided a systematic way in which to explore 'local' issues by taking a 'whole system' perspective. The findings showed that two important influences on the successful implementation of the interventions were the existence and capacity of local organisations and their relationships with government agencies. The analysis provided a dynamic picture of shared influences on the interventions in different communities and in doing so offered insight into intervention effectiveness. It is argued in this article that, for examining intervention effectiveness, it is essential to have a theoretical understanding of the behaviour of the complex system in which they are implemented. This theoretical understanding has implications for the appropriate design of interventions to reduce health inequalities, and in turn should lead to more meaningful ways to evaluate them.",

This article introduces a framework for evaluating projects that have adopted a participatory modeling approach. This evaluation framework--known as the ``Protocol of Canberra''--was developed through a collaboration between French and Australian researchers engaged in participatory modeling and evaluation research. The framework seeks to assess the extent to which different participatory modeling initiatives not only modify perceptions among and interactions between participants, but also contribute to collective decision-making. The article discusses the development of the framework and its application to three case-studies, two from Australia and one from the Pacific Island of the Republic of Kiribati.

abstract="Widespread presence of human pharmaceuticals in water resources across the globe is documented. While some, but certainly not enough, research on the occurrence, fate and effect of pharmaceuticals in water resources has been carried out, a holistic risk management strategy is missing. The transdisciplinary research project ``start'' aimed to develop an integrative strategy by the participation of experts representing key actors in the problem field ``pharmaceuticals in drinking water''. In this paper, we describe a novel modelling method, actor modelling with the semi-quantitative software DANA (Dynamic Actor Network Analysis), and its application in support of identifying an integrative risk management strategy. Based on the individual perceptions of different actors, the approach allows the identification of optimal strategies. Actors' perceptions were elicited by participatory model building and interviews, and were then modelled in perception graphs. Actor modelling indicated that an integrative strategy that targets environmentally-responsible prescription, therapy, and disposal of pharmaceuticals on one hand, and the development of environmentally-friendly pharmaceuticals on the other hand, will likely be most effective for reducing the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water (at least in Germany where the study was performed). However, unlike most other actors, the pharmaceutical industry itself does not perceive that the production of environmentally-friendly pharmaceuticals is an action that helps to achieve its goals, but contends that continued development of highly active pharmaceutical ingredients will help to reduce the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle. Investment in advanced waste or drinking water treatment is opposed by both the wastewater treatment company and the drinking water supplier, and is not mentioned as appropriate by the other actors. According to our experience, actor modelling is a useful method to suggest effective and realisable integrative risk management strategies in complex problem fields that involve many societal actors.",

The paper relates how the tools functioned relatively successfully as analytical devices for the action researcher, but did not significantly contribute to further interprofessional collaboration or enhance dialogue between the action researcher and the project members. Issues of how to use the tools to support more effectively the existing dialogue across professional cultures and traditions are discussed.",

abstract="Modelling tools have been widely used to investigate best management practices. But in contrast to the plethora of modelling studies, the practical implementation of outcomes is comparatively small. There is an urgent need to implement results and to show the practical validation of the concept developed, especially against the context of water stress mitigation. The participative development of modelling studies as a joint effort of stakeholders and modellers is seen as a key to achieve a wider identification, acceptance, trust and applicability of results. Participatory planning in the water sector is also increasingly requested in water management, where tasks have been for clarified decades through different institutional arrangements and national laws. Stakeholder involvement in water resources management have been limited to what was long time seen as participation, merely information on action to be taken. In the last decade the need for participation has been reflected in different ways. In Europe, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) under Art. 14, requires all the European countries to involve stakeholders in decision making processes on water resource management. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the research framework and possible results of investigating dam modelling through participatory systems modelling. We introduce a structured approach to use participatory modelling (PM) for stimulating the integration of modelling and decision making, also as a way of implementation of some articles of the WFD. The results and the framing of this paper are part of the AQUASTRESS Project. The conceptual modelling has been developed by a multidisciplinary research team, local stakeholders and local experts. Some results are discussed and recommendations made.",

In line with the system of care approach, the objectives of BSSI included reducing fragmentation of efforts and delivering integrated services to families of young children exposed to or at risk of exposure to family violence. Interagency collaboration was examined via social network and focus group data collected at three time points starting at baseline. Network analysis findings suggest that over time the network structure became consistent with BSSI's vision of an ideal collaborative network structure. Focus group findings, however, present a more complex picture of the status of collaboration. This paper sheds light on approaches and challenges to measuring interagency collaboration in a service delivery system and communicating social network analysis findings to stakeholders in a way that is accessible and useful.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The Dementia Care Networks' Study examined the effectiveness of four community-based, not-for-profit dementia networks. The study involved assessing the relationship between the types of administrative and service-delivery exchanges that occurred among the networked agencies and the network members' perception of the effectiveness of these exchanges. DESIGN AND METHODS: With the use of a case-study method, the evolution, structure, and processes of each network were documented. Social network analysis using a standardized questionnaire completed by member agencies identified patterns of administrative and clinical exchanges among networked agencies. RESULTS: Differences were found between the four networks in terms of their perceptions of service-delivery effectiveness; perceptions of administrative effectiveness did not factor significantly. Exchanges between groups of agencies (cliques) within each of the four networks were found to be more critical than those between individual agencies within each network. IMPLICATIONS: Integration-measured by the types of exchanges within as opposed to across networks-differentiated the four networks studied. This research contributes to our understanding of the use of multiple measures to evaluate the inner workings of service delivery and their impact on elder health and elder health care.",

abstract="This study investigates the links between community readiness and the social networks among participants in Communities That Care (CTC), community-based prevention coalitions. The coalitions targeted adolescent behavior problems through community risk factor assessments, prioritization of risk factors, and selection/implementation of corresponding evidence-based family, school, and community programs. Key leaders (n = 219) in 23 new CTC sites completed questionnaires focusing on community readiness to implement CTC and the respondents' personal, work, and social organization links to other key leaders in the community. Outside technical assistants also completed ratings of each community's readiness and early CTC functioning. Measures of network cohesion/integration were positively associated with readiness, while centralization was negatively associated. These results suggest that non-centralized networks in which ties between members are close and direct may be an indicator of community readiness. In addition, we found different associations between readiness and different domains of social relations. EDITORS' STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS: The authors present the promising practice of using social network analysis to characterize the functioning of local prevention coalitions and their readiness to implement a community-based prevention initiative. Researchers and community planners will benefit from the lessons in this article, which capitalizes on a large sample and multiple informants. This work raises interesting questions about how to combine the promotion of coalition functioning while simultaneously encouraging diversity of coalition membership.",

abstract="Put Prevention into Practice (PPIP), a national initiative promoting evidence-based clinical preventive services, was atheoretical in its approach to change. In 1994, the Texas Department of Health began demonstration projects to implement PPIP in grantee primary care sites across the state. They funded implementation and evaluation projects that resulted in eight years of experience with the process. Gathering both qualitative and quantitative data, the Texas Department of Health and the University of Texas researchers found action research essential to learning how to successfully support clinical sites in the implementation of PPIP. The researchers also found the need for on-site consultative assistance and a participatory problem-solving approach in order to produce desired systems change. A complex adaptive systems' perspective gave theoretical justification for action research, the composition of the PPIP Implementation Model, and the importance of specific adaptation by clinics. Thus, the eight-year action research project found that a state health department desiring to implement and institutionalize quality health care should focus on: (1) context-specific consultation, (2) recognition of complexity and system-level constructs, and (3) the requirement for participatory change.",

Then we explain unintended consequences of faculty hiring decisions. Finally, we discuss the issue of faculty salary inequity and how it may lead to performance and financial problems. We believe these maps will be of value to higher education administrators seeking to support faculty success and looking for ways to enhance their strategic planning process.

abstract="An important limitation of the management information systems (MIS) literature concerns the lack of a process model to understand how a system is assimilated by the organization. We seek to contribute to this topic through studying ERP adoption in two Chilean restaurants. In this paper is proposed that adoption occurs as a process composed of four stages and, therefore, it is presented findings from three of them. We used action-research (AR) as a methodological framework. Two AR cycles were performed in each case. Qualitative data was collected from the field through video recording, interviews, observation and social network analysis. Analysis data was analyzed by comparing results within-cases and between-cases. Three conclusions were reached: (1) during the implementation, a user-system negotiation cycle occurs; (2) after assimilating, the system must be constantly confirmed, otherwise can be abandoned; (3) speed of assimilation by group users depends of degree of influence in the social group of early adopters. Interestingly, an innovative micro-business owner could become a barrier to successful assimilation of a system. Findings introduce a dissenting view to most studies that have found that involvement of management is always beneficial to the success of a technology project. Our findings show involvement of owner impacts a successful adoption, but this impact is not because that person is the owner, but because of their degree of influence on the social group. Conclusions of this study will be of interest to micro, small and medium-business owners because it shows the value of social structure of the organization as a determinant of the success of a technological project.

In an effort to bridge levels of analysis from the individual to the small group to the community, we analyzed how a group of students introduced, sustained, and eventually let go of one topic while participating in a classroom discussion that took place in a CSCL environment. Our purpose was to examine a single posted message's influence not only through the responses it garnered, but also by how individuals reacted to it intellectually. Participants were eight students and their teacher in a graduate-level seminar. Data sources included the online discussion's final transcript, screen-captured recordings of each participant's computer screen, video recordings of participants' actions, and observation notes. Our analyses revealed three key understandings: (a) the interdependencies of process and content are manifestations of the complex development of co-created understandings in computer-supported discussions, (b) private individual processes and particular meanings co-mingle in a social space to create publicly shared experiences, and (c) the importance of attending to the content was shown in the details of a topic's incipience, its developing ``mid-life,'' and how factors conspired to its end. These findings help illustrate how co-created meaning-making experiences emerge in a system through interactions among individual agents, suggesting ways instructors may work to foster student learning in CSCL contexts.

abstract="Instructors' discussion design and facilitation have critical influences on online learning community development. Emerging network analysis methods were used to examine the development of an online learning community within a graduate-level course, the variations of an experienced instructor's discussion design, and the dynamics of her discussion facilitation. Results indicated that students gradually formed an interactive online learning community. The instructor, overall, played a facilitator role in this community; yet her participatory roles varied within different discussions during different time frames. Her participatory role evolved from a guide in the first class discussion, to varying roles, i.e., a facilitator, an observer, and a collaborator within different group discussions at the middle stages of the course, and to an observer in the course's later stages. Methodological implications for using social network analysis in online learning community research, and practical implications for designing and facilitating discussions that foster online learning communities were proposed.

abstract="The purpose of this article is to analyze systemically the Brazilian production chain of semiconductors. The specific objectives of this article are to represent the chain systemically and to identify key variables and leverage points that can increase the overall performance of the semiconductor industry. The research method is qualitative modelling. Eleven practitioners of the industry answered a questionnaire approaching various aspects of the semiconductor industry in Brazil. By a systemic approach, the complex behavior present in the industry was considered. By content analysis, we identified patterns in the speech of the respondents. Texts fragments allowed the identification of key themes and variables present in the system. The association among key variables and complex behavior helped to build a systemic structure, aimed at representing the main relationships in the system. From the systemic structure, eight leverage points were identified and discussed. The key implications of the findings are the damage that cheap imports make in the local market; the need of strong public policies that include more than tax reduction, but also local conditions, like clusters or technological parks, for the high-tech manufacture; and the promotion of conditions that stimulate private investment in the industry.

abstract="More youth-based environmental engagement programs (EEPs) are needed to help combat the impact of climate change. Current programs just focus their content on individual-level personal practices (e.g., recycling); are designed to be implemented in one setting with little regard for broader implications or opportunities for contextual adaption; and collect little evaluative information about how programs are developed, implemented, and evaluated. In this article, the authors present an example of how these limitations might be addressed through Youth Leading Environmental Change (YLEC), an evidence-based international EEP designed to build young people's capacity for collective action. The goal of this analysis is to explore one specific aspect of this program, fostering systems thinking, which is a critical element of the underlying theory of engagement and a critical skill in finding approaches to dealing with complex problems. Systems thinking is a form of analysis or thought process that places emphasis on how a problem interacts in complex ways with the systems in which it was created. We investigate how two novel program components, a local speaker's personal account of an environmental injustice and a live video exchange of participants from the global North and South (with different experiences of negative environmental impacts), promote systems thinking. We also illustrate how participants' increased capacity in systems thinking resulted in them being more motivated and engaged in collective environmental action. Thirty-four 60 minute semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with participants in Bangladesh, Canada, and India. Findings suggest that participants' experiences of the two program components built their capacity to think about environmental issues at higher levels of systemic complexity, which, in turn, resulted in increased engagement in environmental action.

It therefore enabled surfacing of human/cultural and organisational issues that would have negatively affected the adoption of the new system; these were successfully resolved.

abstract="This article reflects on the way in which the path creation theorem influenced an intervention designed to overcome an intractable challenge during a community-university partnership in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. The intractable challenge related to the legacy of the Abstain, Be Faithful, Condomise (ABC) campaign that was mounted in the early 1990s to reduce the global impact of HIV/AIDS. Despite the context of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic having shifted significantly since the ABC slogan was invented, the community partner-who focus on HIV/AIDS-related work-reported that the ABC-legacy continued to be a source of frustration in their work. In order to begin the process of overcoming the challenge, the partnership decided to go beyond the conventional boundaries of community-based HIV/AIDS discourses and develop an intervention influenced by complexity. The guiding heuristic for the design was the path creation theorem, placing special emphasis on the initial conditions, contingency, self-reinforcing mechanisms and lock-ins. The findings from the reflection indicate that concepts associated with path creation added value to the design-particularly from the perspective of incorporating processes of emergence over contingent events. The article concludes by suggesting that the path creation theorem was a flexible heuristic and that the application may have opened opportunities to explore the synergies between managing complex systems and more conventional forms of managing community-based interventions relating to HIV/AIDS.

Students, however, often have difficulty learning these components, and limited research exists to understand what types of interventions may best help improve understanding. We investigated 32 high school students' understandings of complex systems components and whether an agent-based simulation could improve their understandings. Pretest and posttest essays were coded for changes in six components to determine whether students showed more expert thinking about the complex system of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Results showed significant improvement for the components Emergence (r = .26, p = .03), Order (r = .37, p = .002), and Tradeoffs (r = .44, p = .001). Implications include that the experiential nature of the simulation has the potential to support conceptual change for some complex systems components, presenting a promising option for complex systems instruction.

Traditional approaches to RLX safety have focused on the implementation of technology such as warnings and barriers to control road user behaviour. However, as RLXs are complex sociotechnical systems, there is a need to apply systems-based approaches to analysis and design within this domain. This will enable road and rail stakeholders to develop innovative design solutions which are appropriate for the complexity of the domain, including adaptability to future changes in a dynamic transport environment. This paper describes the use of one aspect of a systems thinking-based design toolkit to prompt design insights following the application of the cognitive work analysis framework to RLXs. The process resulted in the identification of design insights for use in a participatory design process and supported the research team to consider the principles of sociotechnical systems theory.

abstract="In this paper, we propose a framework for applying the combined use of soft systems methodology (SSM) and critical discourse analysis (CDA) based on social semiotic systemic functional linguistics to social practices. In the social practice, 'participation' mode of Checkland's SSM is used for 'problem-solving' whilst CDA is used to problematize 'problem-solving' processes within the practice. During the meta-process of problematization of our research, we used Churchman's systems approach and its theory of 'boundary critique' in order to explore issues such as governance, inequality of power, and social values within the organization examined for this study. In other words, the process-oriented methodology proposed in this paper consists of two processes: that of 'problem-solving' based on SSM and of problematization of naturalized discourse from the perspective of CDA and two phases of boundary critique in social practice. A detailed account of a case study of Korean social enterprise is given to demonstrate how our proposed framework of the combined use of SSM and CDA is applied into practice. Reflecting the outcome of the case study, this paper argues that critical social research from systemic inquiry using what we call 'process-oriented methodology' is useful to address some of the social and complex issues related to understanding dynamic relation between power and discourse amongst participants in the social enterprise in Korean contexts.

abstract="Purpose: This paper aims to contribute towards understanding how safety knowledge can be elicited from railway experts for the purposes of supporting effective decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: A consortium of safety experts from across the British railway industry is formed. Collaborative modelling of the knowledge domain is used as an approach to the elicitation of safety knowledge from experts. From this, a series of knowledge models is derived to inform decision-making. This is achieved by using Bayesian networks as a knowledge modelling scheme, underpinning a Safety Prognosis tool to serve meaningful prognostics information and visualise such information to predict safety violations. Findings: Collaborative modelling of safety-critical knowledge is a valid approach to knowledge elicitation and its sharing across the railway industry. This approach overcomes some of the key limitations of existing approaches to knowledge elicitation. Such models become an effective tool for prediction of safety cases by using railway data. This is demonstrated using passenger-train interaction safety data. Practical implications: This study contributes to practice in two main directions: by documenting an effective approach to knowledge elicitation and knowledge sharing, while also helping the transport industry to understand safety. Social implications: By supporting the railway industry in their efforts to understand safety, this research has the potential to benefit railway passengers, staff and communities in general, which is a priority for the transport sector. Originality/value: This research applies a knowledge elicitation approach to understanding safety based on collaborative modelling, which is a novel approach in the context of transport.

abstract="Both complex systems methods (such as agent-based modeling) and computational methods (such as programming) provide powerful ways for students to understand new phenomena. To understand how to effectively teach complex systems and computational content to younger students, we conducted a study in four urban middle school classrooms comparing 2-week-long curricular units-one using a physical robotics participatory simulation and one using a virtual robotics participatory simulation. We compare the two units for their effectiveness in supporting students' complex systems thinking and computational thinking skills. We find that while both units improved student outcomes to roughly the same extent, they engendered different perspectives on the content. That is, students using the physical system were more likely to interpret situations from a bottom-up (``agent'') perspective, and students using the virtual system were more likely to employ a top-down (``aggregate'') perspective. Our outcomes suggest that the medium of students' interactions with systems leads to differences in their learning from and about those systems. We explore the reasons for and effects of these differences, challenges in teaching this content, and student learning gains. The paper contributes operationalizable definitions of complex systems perspectives and computational perspectives and provides both a theoretical framework for and empirical evidence of a relationship between those two perspectives.

abstract="This is the second paper which makes a case in a two part paper. The first paper was titled ``The quality of life of Sri Lankan Children: Participatory Action Research (PAR) to address the governance issues of the Voluntary Children's Homes'' (Ariyadasa and McIntyre-Mills, Quality of life of Sri Lankan children: participatory action research to address the governance issues of voluntary children's homes, 2014). The first paper explored the governance issues of the Sri Lankan children's homes and clarified that institutionalized children are denied their rights, often because their re-integration process is not efficient and/or effective. Thus, this paper addresses the issue of systemic governance of the re-integration process of the voluntary children's homes as part of PhD research using PAR and critical systemic praxis undertaken at Flinders University. The research addresses the major task for policy makers and service providers to ensure that institutionalised children are supported by a systemic program that addresses their complex social needs. The research was conducted across all nine provinces in Sri Lanka, involving policy makers and service providers responsible for institutional care of children. All nine commissioners of the provincial departments of probation and child care services were interviewed to collect information on policy implications and their role in the policy making process. Thirty managers from different children's homes were interviewed to ascertain information with regards to their service provision. All 298 probation officers, 287 child rights promotion officers, and matrons and wardens of all 416 children's homes were included in a questionnaire census approach. Of these, approximately half responded. The aim of the research is to advocate for the standard of care the children receive, and the life chances they deserve in order for them to reach their full potential and integrate into their societies when they leave the children's homes. In achieving this aim, the paper discusses the significance of re-integration and critiques the existing re-integration mechanism using this PAR's empirical and secondary data. Furthermore, by applying Ulrich's Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH), through this paper, we attempt to explore praxis to address the social justice challenge encountered by institutionalized children. The 12 boundary questions of CSH in the actual and ideal modes (Flood and Romm, Critical systems thinking: current research and practice, 1996) have made a platform to inquire the process by which plans are implemented and evaluated.

We develop an ABM for wetlands managers to use to simulate the outcome of a marketing plan for promotion of environmental tourism in a wetlands area. The wetlands managers must trade off the costs of marketing and the damage done by the tourism activities with the value of ecotourism for the wetland.

Method: This qualitative study uses interviews from 11 nursing and 18 dental students to compare the experiences of conventional training (CON-dental students) with intra-oral radiography simulation (SIM-dental students) and cervical spine simulation training (nursing students). Results: The analysis showed that the simulation and conventional training influenced reflective thought processes in different ways. The SIM students concentrated on the visual information before and after they made their choices, whereas the CON students, in the absence of three-dimensional characters and reference points, focused on discussions and mutual agreements within the group to achieve a solution. The visual feedback and opportunities for manipulation provided by the simulation training encouraged the SIM-students to examine their assumptions and actions (to reflect-in-action) while solving the task. Prior knowledge served as a theoretical and methodological scheme guiding the learners' actions and directed their reflection on their existing anatomical knowledge. Conclusions: SIM and CON training provide different conditions for students' reflective thought processes, and these differences influence how well the groups learn radiological principles.

abstract="In the United States, community coalitions are an important part of the public health milieu, and thus, subject to many of the same external pressures as other organizations-including changes in required strategic orientation. Many funding agencies have shifted their funding agenda from program development to policy change. Thus, the Florida Prevention Research Center created the Community-Based Prevention Marketing (CBPM) for Policy Development framework to teach community coalitions how to apply social marketing to policy change. The research reported here was designed to explicate the framework's theory of change. We describe and demonstrate a hybrid evaluation approach: utilization-focused developmental evaluation. The research question was ``What are the linkages and connections among CBPM inputs, activities, immediate outcomes, intermediate outcomes, and ultimate impacts?'' We implemented a case study design, with the case being a normative community coalition. The study adhered to a well-developed series of steps for system dynamics modeling. Community coalition leaders may expect CBPM to provide immediate gains in coalition performance. Results from causal diagramming show how gains in performance are delayed and follow an initial decline in performance. We discuss the practical implications for CBPM's developers-for example, importance of managing coalition expectations-and other social marketers-for example, expansion of the evaluation toolkit.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-19757-002). This article reports on a study in which activity theory was used to design, implement, and analyze a 10-week curriculum unit about how honeybees collect nectar with a particular focus on complex systems concepts. Students (n = 42) in a multi-year kindergarten and 1st-grade classroom participated in this study as part of their 10 regular classroom activity. The curricular unit was composed of 4 specific activity types, each of which was intended to focus students on a particular dimension of the content: (a) Inquiry with BeeSign software was intended to help students explore the benefit of individual nectar-collecting behaviors for the hive as a whole; (b) traditional drawing activities were intended to help students learn the structures of 15 the bees; (c) participatory representation activities, in which students enacted the behavior of the bees as they collect nectar, were intended to help students link bee structures to individual behaviors; and (d) an embodied nectar-gathering game was intended to help the students recognize the challenges of finding nectar for individual bees. Pre- and posttest interviews reveal a shift in individual student understanding 20 as students progressed from discussing the superficial structures of the system to discussing both behaviors and functions.

abstract="A framework based on Ulrich's critical systems heuristics (CSH) is presented to organize second-order critical inquiry in systems practice and action research. It is argued that such an approach not only improves the rigour of systems methodologies in action in a specific 'situation of interest' but also brings rigour to research aimed at improving systems practice. The paper draws on critical systems heuristics and illustrates its application in the context of an intervention using Checkland's soft systems methodology to discuss the environmental impact of mining operations in southern Peru. We sketch the context in which the systemic intervention was carried out, reporting on the initial soft systems methodology stages (relevant systems, root definitions and CATWOE analysis) produced in workshops with stakeholders. The paper illustrates how learning about improvement in systems practice can be guided with the use of second-order boundary critique. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

abstract="Two systemic inquiries, based on soft systems methodology (SSM), into the potential for using community of practice (CoP) theory by an Australian-government created research and development corporation to change its knowledge management (KM) strategy, are reported. Key staff were engaged in the inquiry into how to build a third-order KM strategy based on CoPs; an exploration of key published work on CoPs yielded four SSM activity models-'being a community practice system'; 'doing the work of imagination sub-system'; 'doing the work of alignment sub-system' and 'doing the work of engagement sub-system'. These models can be used as heuristics to aid the purposeful design of CoPs in other settings. SSM, enacted as a systemic inquiry, can be understood as a form of systemic action research, which was well equipped to deal with CoP theory and, when enacted participatively, can generate important systemic insights. The inquiry began the process of fostering an appreciation of third order KM but, on the evidence available, did not lead to on-going commitment to a CoPs-based KM strategy. Future research should acknowledge how the framing of research situations influences the research process, the importance of the design of practice change settings and the limited evidence for purposeful interventions leading to successful CoPs.

abstract="Community-based organizations (CBOs) generally face challenges of meeting clients' complex needs with limited resources. Partnership development can be a strategy for the CBOs to expand capacity and improve performance. However, relevant evidence is scant and tends to lack a theoretical base. This study examines the relation between networking and performance of a CBO from the perspective of social network analysis. The sample consists of 15 CBOs relying on volunteers to provide primary care services for older adults in a suburban area of Taiwan. Data analyzed include an expert evaluation record, a sociomatrix data set denoting the CBOs' relationships, and a focus group of the social workers supporting the CBOs' services. The breadth, brokerage, and embeddedness of networking are measured by centrality indicators and are hypothesized as being beneficial for service performance in terms of effectiveness and innovation. The study reveals that brokerage and embeddedness of networking are positively associated with effectiveness. A CBO may enhance its performance by bridging less connected organizations that need the relationship or by partnering with other organizations that bring in information from many others, but a wide social network is not necessarily helpful. Future studies can strengthen the findings by employing large samples and advanced statistical methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

This paper reports on action research (AR) that sought to improve the effectiveness a UK university's student record system (SRS), which had exhibited persistent problems. Critical systems thinking (CST) is seen to have value for ISD and was used to guide the AR. In the first stage of this research, the issues with the initial design of the SRS were identified to have largely resulted from insufficient elicitation of the underlying assumptions about, and perspectives on, complex organisational issues. The second stage centred on examining the situation from an ``ought'' perspective analysing what should be done and how, in order to develop creative solutions to the problems uncovered. The third stage involved recommending solutions to address the problems identified in order to improve the effectiveness of the SRS. Overall, the AR indicates that CST enables those involved to view the design and implementation of the SRS as a holistic system, critically reflect upon broad and complex human, technological and organisational issues from different perspectives, and thereby identify creative solutions. The main contribution of this research is in generating support for an ISD intervention guided by CST. The results of, and the understanding developed from, this intervention are likely to be relevant to the problems that frequently occur in similar situations.

This article attempts to fill this research gap by exploring website management issues within 17 organizations in two locations: Victoria, Australia and Tuscany, Italy. Integral to the research was an examination of structural barriers and interorganizational relationships that act to facilitate the take-up, or otherwise, of technology. Theory regarding the diffusion of innovations and social network analysis provided the background. The qualitative method chosen for the study was constructivist grounded theory. The sample was purposively selected and data collection included semi-structured interviews with key actors; the mapping of organizational relationships; and the examination of websites. The findings indicate that organizations with a combination of good internal skills, and strong access to external advice and skills are in the best position to create websites that satisfy their needs, with good access to external information and communication technology services and advice more important than strong internal skills. Organizations must also consider how to deal with six broad areas related to the development and maintenance of websites: strategy; technical knowledge and design; project management; support; training; and funding. The conclusion sums up the views of the organizations in the study about the best ways to gain the skills they need to provide good web design.

A major one is the need to easily and succinctly present complexity in a way that is meaningful for stakeholders and supports developing their connections to take effective joint action. The Global Finance Initiative (GFI) explored the use of three different visual mapping methodologies to help address this challenge. These are associated with social network analysis methodologies. But of course other issues with a global action research project also are significant. Identifying participants requires selecting from billions of people who are stakeholders. Additionally, this project also explored the role of action researchers as initiators of change, rather than ones invited into a change arena.

The objective of the Fair Tracing project was to support both producers and consumers in their decision-making in Fair Trade value chains by using information and communication technologies to provide them with information. Based on survey data, formal and informal interviews, group meetings, accompanied shopping and a design workshop with potential users, the project applied the bottom-up, participatory approach to technology design that the capabilities approach demands. Key challenges that were encountered included the competing capabilities of making informed buying decisions and of having more time.

This paper explores the use of qualitative system dynamics tools and a participatory modelling approach to support scoping stages of an integrated sustainability assessment (ISA) process. To facilitate mapping of maritime sustainability issues in Portugal, a series of preparatory interviews allowed eliciting stakeholders' perceptions and their alignment with current public policies. In the subsequent participatory modelling workshop, stakeholders deliberated on maritime problems and constructed causal loop diagrams, identifying feedback structures and voting on leverage points to intervene in the system. Overall results show that the process generated positive outcomes at individual and group levels, stimulating basic systems thinking knowledge and skills. Although further time for model iteration was suggested, the proposed approach promoted learning and a transition toward a shared and more holistic view of maritime problems and its underlying causal interrelationships. This is a promising result for the use of participatory modelling approaches as platforms supporting emerging ISA frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

abstract="Urban centers face complex challenges in managing their services to continually improve their citizens' quality of life. They also face complex challenges in managing citizens' perceptions of the effectiveness of services to continually improve their resulting quality of life. We view urban areas as dynamic sociocultural systems, meaning that effectively and dynamically understanding and addressing their challenges means confronting the full complexity of factors that interact to make up the system. More precisely, we understand these systems to be complex service systems, arrangements of multiple entities and stakeholders that interact to co-create value. Decision makers of urban centers face the design problem of arranging the entities so that the most mutual value emerges from their interactions. To analyze and understand such complex systems, we suggest a new approach to service system analysis based on model composition to design and evaluate stakeholder relationships through what-if scenarios. Applied to the intriguing real-world scenario of crime and perceptions of crime in the London Borough of Sutton, we show how service system analysis-analyzing value constellations to find opportunities for reconfiguring roles and relationships that unlock value-can be applied to a sociocultural service system by focusing on the complex relationship among components that can influence complex questions, such as safety and quality-of-community. Modeling and simulating the value constellations of complex service systems can help us discover which interventions and reconfigurations will be effective and which will not.

This analysis is critical to documenting the changes in social capital and networks that result from community based K-12 educational collaborations. We review SNA and show an application of this technique in a school-centered, community based environmental monitoring research (CBEMR) program. This CBEMR employs K-12 students, state and local government employees, environmental organization representatives, local businesses, colleges, and community volunteers. As citizen scientists and researchers, collaborators create a database of local groundwater quality to use as a baseline for long-term environmental health management and public education. Past studies have evaluated the reliability of data generated by students acting as scientists, but there have been few studies relating to power dynamics, social capital, and resilience in school-centered CBEMR programs. We use qualitative and quantitative data gathered from a science education program conducted in five states in the northeastern United States. SPSS and NVivo data were derived from semi-structured interviews with thirty-nine participants before and after their participation in the CBEMR. Pajek software was used to determine participant centralities and power brokers within networks. Results indicate that there were statistically significant increases in social capital and resilience in social networks after participation in the school-centered CBEMR program leading to an increased community involvement in environmental health management.

The paper focuses on understanding the key roles played by club leaders in facilitating change and transformation in these contexts, particularly in terms of alcohol-related practices and the potential impact of these on young people's uses and understanding of alcohol. We situate these findings in a framework that draws on the literature of complexity science and complex adaptive systems (CAS) to suggest that these practices and changes need to be understood in ways that allow for complexity, uncertainty, emergent behaviours and adaptive change.

abstract="Land use planning and policy making for environmental systems involve uncertainty, long time scales, and complex socio-natural systems and processes; most decisions are often characterized by conflict and tension and give rise to disagreements which are widely considered and managed as disagreement about socio-environmental values. Although the growing acceptance of participatory models in environmental planning and policymaking is forcing the public authorities to implement participatory mechanisms, participation practices are not showing much effectiveness in reducing conflict and tension. This paper argues that negotiation approaches in participatory decision making often pose the attention on disputing actors and their related values (in the field of environmental planning, on socio-environmental values) thus amplifying the risk for conflict to sharpen. Participation practices, in fact, often use Decision and Conflict Analysis models as means to disclose structures of parties' values and preferences to parties themselves, thus risking to enhance sources for conflict and tension. In this article, participation is conceptualized as an exploration process looking for decision 'opportunities' which allow transforming participatory decision making into operational collaboration. To illustrate the discussion we present a case of participatory decision making process in the Torre Guaceto wetland, a Natural Reserve in Southern Italy. The process refers to the formulation of the land use plan and is analysed by the application of a cognitive model. The analysis shows how the negotiation process evolves from a conflict to collaboration and becomes centred on the content of the decision rather than the social and environmental values involved.

We move beyond this discussion to demonstrate how knowledge gained from analysing the social networks of stakeholders can be harnessed for selecting stakeholders, and further, how these analyses can be influenced by the expressed wishes and concerns of stakeholders. Although we began our SNA using concepts derived from the resource-management literature, stakeholder involvement in the interpretation of the results led to the use of SNA techniques that had not previously been applied in the context of resource management. We thus re-analysed our data and modified our selection of research participants. Re-analysis led to the selection of research participants who (1) had unique positions in the network, thus occupying non-redundant communication roles in the network, (2) came from different stakeholder categories and (3) were relatively well-connected to others and tended to broker across different segments of the network. By combining insights from researchers and stakeholders in this way, it was possible to use SNA in an innovative and sensitive way to better meet the needs of the stakeholders and the research project.

abstract="Purpose: In many organisations a lot of effort is put into the formation of a strategy, but the implementation of strategies is lacking. This paper aims to explore the preconditions for a successful strategy process (i.e. a process which results in implementation) in the context of municipal services in Finland. As a case study, the implementation of the city strategy in the home care services in one Finnish municipality is to be examined. The practical goal is to explain, why the implementation of strategy is lacking. The theoretical purpose is to find prerequisites for successful strategy implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The project was carried out by using an action research approach. The data collection and analysis methods were qualitative, including semi-structured interviews, visual modelling of the strategy processes and observation of group discussions during the intervention day. The content of all the ten transcribed interviews and the transcription of the intervention were systematically analysed. In the context of the city strategy process, two types of fundamental prerequisites for learning were studied: the significance given to the strategy work, and the experience of agency in the strategy process. Findings: The participants in the strategy process were divided into three different organisational levels, the experiences were consistent within organisational levels but they differed between them. Both the strategic- and operative-level employees considered the strategic level as active strategy makers and the operative level as passive receivers of the strategy. Furthermore, the management-level employees gave high significance to the strategy process, while the significance given to the strategy process by the politicians and the operative-level employees was low. The above-mentioned findings may be the reasons why the commitment of staff members to the strategy was low and its implementation ineffective. Practical implications: In the strategy process of the case municipality, the understanding of the strategy process seemed to be fragmented and rigid, because the spontaneous conceptions of strategy were not problematised and discussed throughout the organisation. To build up a meaningful understanding of the strategy process, the spontaneous conceptions of strategy should be processed at all levels of the organisation. Furthermore, to prevent understanding from becoming fragmentated, the strategy representations should be processed in a common process. If it is supposed to be implemented, the strategy process should be seen as a continuous and comprehensive learning process. Originality/value: The strategy process is a complex system in which many factors interact simultaneously. Despite this, the relationship between individual learning processes and the strategy process has not been researched before. The paper explores the strategy process as a holistic and systemic learning process in which individual and shared collaborative processes are intertwined.

abstract="Purpose: This paper aims to develop an approach for improving linguistic skills to enhance work collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: A framework has been developed using principles of complex systems thinking, cultural-historical activity theory and theories of intercultural communication in an action research setting. Findings: Organisational development and change are never a straightforward task, which the case clearly demonstrates. These are tension-filled processes of continuously changing power relationships and distances between people. The development of shared sense making is an iterative learning process. Co-developing shared communication strategies enhances dialogue and collaboration. Research limitations/implications: A single and in practice unsuccessful case has been the basis of the research findings. Although saturation of data was therefore never reached, typical inhibiting factors were brought to the surface. Controversy and underlying inhibitions may not always be easy to detect in successful cases. The understanding from this unsuccessful case may therefore be helpful for further research. Practical implications: Collaboration and change in the workplace are complex processes and are therefore difficult to implement. Collective approaches for developing communication strategies are highly dependent on including all affected actors. Originality/value: The realisation of the complexity of organisational change processes is important. This creates an awareness of a need and responsibility for everyone affected to try and co-develop the practices for change. It is the bringing together of the diverse experiences into learning processes through dialogue that facilitates these changes. There must be an appreciation that the outcome is still unpredictable in a process of change. Collective ownership of the changes is essential for success.

Data indicate increasingly effective procedures, mirrored in students' knowledge advances, corresponding to the following organizations: (a) Year 1-fixed small-groups; (b) Year 2-interacting small-groups with substantial cross-group knowledge sharing; and (c) Year 3-opportunistic collaboration, with small teams forming and disbanding under the volition of community members, based on emergent goals. The third-year model maps most directly onto organic and distributed social structures in real-world knowledge- creating organizations and resulted in the highest level of collective cognitive responsibility, knowledge advancement, and dynamic diffusion of information. Pedagogical and technological innovations to enculturate youth into a knowledge-creating culture, with classroom practices to encourage distributed and opportunistic collaboration, are discussed.

abstract="Marching toward the 21st century, there are not only drastic changes in global economic and political development, but also in technological advancement and ecological evolution. All of these are intertwined with one another to shape national and societal development in various areas. In the milieu of education, these changes exert great influence on the way we perceive learning and instruction, this in turn calls for a paradigm shift in the way we design learning and instruction. Consequently, calls to critically examine the way we have been designing our learning and instruction have gained more and more attention in the past decade. Since design could help in realizing our visionary ideals, and transforming these ideals into innumerable learning and working contexts, we need to probe into how our learning and instruction could be more creatively and powerfully designed. The author contends that most learners, through the process of critical envision and enaction, could learn to design their own learning, either independently or collectively, through the cultivation of design capacities. In this paper, the author first presents the historical analysis of the theoretical foundations of instructional design, and then takes a critical approach to examining the alternative possibilities of instructional design. Based on the critical perspectives of design, she develops the critical design inquiry by integrating the richness of contemporary critical thinking into that of systems thinking and design thinking. To make the critical design inquiry an educational praxis, rather than just another design theory, the author takes a participatory and collaborative approach to design with a group of adult students. The critical design approach aims at enlightening the adult learners' inner systems revolution and enriching the outer learning environments through collaborative design engagement. In the final section, the author explicates how the confined roles of instructional designers could be conceptualized through the critical design inquiry.

The process-oriented holonic modelling methodology combines aspects of softer and harder approaches to aid modellers in designing business processes and associated IS. The methodology uses holistic thinking and a construct known as the holon to build process descriptions into a set of models known as a holarchy. This paper describes the methodology through an action research case study based in a large design and manufacturing organization. The scientific contribution is a methodology for analysing business processes in environments that are characterized by high complexity, low volume and high variety where there are minimal repeated learning opportunities, such as large IS development projects. The practical deliverables from the project gave IS and business process improvements for the case study company. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

We report here on a rapid and low-cost experiment in Lower Silesia, Poland, using modeling techniques to explore the potential to develop local ecological products. We focus our analysis on one particular group of products related to an ``ancient'' breed of chicken, the green-legged hen (GLH), with low resource requirements that could support a sustainable agriculture based on lower use of fertilizers and pesticides. The issues affecting farmers' commitment to adopt GLHs include availability of EU subsidies, the supportive role of NGOs, cooperation between producers, and uncertainty about the future profitability of a relatively untested product. We used this model to evaluate alternative scenarios, nurture the discussion among farmers, and stimulate them to take appropriate action. Gaming with a microworld interface was a crucial breakthrough experience for the farmers to accept and understand the scientific language and methods, and to join the community discussion by actively contributing to improving the model. This positive experience could be a crucial initial step toward the transition from intensive to extensive farming methods, thereby increasing the resilience of natural resource-based rural economies.

It first explains the Systems Thinking concept and briefly outlines its history and emergence in agriculture and natural resource management. A series of case studies are then presented which illustrate practical examples of how Systems Thinking has been used to address real life natural resource management issues. The case studies build on the conclusions of each other by adding additional ways (lessons learnt) of incorporating Systems Thinking into practice to address issues more systemically. The first case study deals with examples of how Systems Thinking facilitated the sharing and integration of disparate sources and forms of knowledge, and making sense of the factors influencing tree density in the tropical savanna region of northern Queensland. The second case study deals with how Systems Thinking has been imbedded in the design and implementation of a research project investigating how to improve financial returns to smallholder tree farmers in the Philippines. The third case study illustrates how Systems Thinking was used to design and facilitate an adaptive rodent management project in Cambodia based on participatory research, development and extension. From these experiences, the authors' highlight a variety of key points that lead to the proposition that Systems Thinking should be 'absorbed' into scientific research, in the same way that statistics, is today an integral part of all sciences.

abstract="The aim of the present study was to investigate the challenges that relate to the implementation of virtual inquiry practises in middle school. The case was a school course in which a group of Finnish students (N=14) and teachers (N=7) completed group inquiries through virtual collaboration, using a web-based learning environment. The task was to accomplish a cross-disciplinary inquiry into cultural issues. The students worked mainly at home and took much responsibility for their course achievements. The investigators analysed the pedagogical design of the course and the content of the participants' interaction patterns in the web-based environment, using qualitative content analysis and social network analysis. The findings suggest that the students succeeded in producing distinctive cultural products, and both the students and the teachers adopted novel roles during the inquiry. The web-based learning environment was used more as a coordination tool for organizing the collaborative work than as a forum for epistemic inquiry. The tension between the school curriculum and the inquiry practises was manifest in the participants' discussions of the assessment criteria of the course.

abstract="Public transportation systems are among the most ubiquitous and complex large-scale systems found in modern society. For those unable to drive such as people with cognitive disabilities, these systems are essential gateways for participation in community activities, socialization, and independence. To understand the magnitude and scope of this national problem, we highlight deficiencies identified in an international study by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council and present specific cognitive barriers identified in empirical studies of transportation systems in several U.S. cities. An interdisciplinary team of HCI researchers, urban transportation planners, commercial technologists, and assistive care specialists are now collaborating on the Mobility-for-All project to create architectures and prototypes that support those with cognitive disabilities and their caregivers. We have grounded our research and design efforts using a distributed cognition framework. We have derived requirements for our designs by analyzing ``how things are'' for individuals with cognitive disabilities who learn and use public transportation systems. We present a socio-technical architecture that has three components: a) a personal travel assistant that uses real-time Global Positioning Systems data from the bus fleet to deliver just-in-time prompts; b) a mobile prompting client and a prompting script configuration tool for caregivers; and c) a monitoring system that collects real-time task status from the mobile client and alerts the support community of potential problems. We then describe a phased community-centered assessment approach that begins at the design stage and continues to be integrated throughout the project. This research has broad implications for designing more human-centered transportation systems that are universally accessible for other disenfranchised communities such as the elderly or nonnative speaker. This project presents an ``in-the-world'' research opportunity that challenges our understanding about mobile human computer interactions with ubiquitous, context-aware computing architectures in noisy, uncontrolled environments; personalization and user modeling techniques; and the design of universally accessible interfaces for complex systems through participatory design processes. This article provides both a near-term vision and an architecture for transportation systems that are socially inclusive, technologically appealing, and easier for everyone to use.

They belong to the class of individual-based modelling approaches, which allow a bottom-up representation of the system being modelled, eliciting its macro-level evolution while modelling the micro-level behavior of its individuals. This paper deals with the application of an ABM to simulate future crop patterns in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg under a pre-defined scenario. The simulated scenario deals with the introduction of a green consciousness component in farmers' decisions, substituting a purely rational approach based only on profit maximization. The results of the ABM are used to perform a life cycle assessment of Luxembourg's agricultural system. The paper first describes the difficulties and the challenges connected with building an ABM for agriculture and then shows the results of the selected case study. The results show that, from a lifecycle perspective, a greenness criterion aimed only at reducing greenhouse gases emissions reveals patently a sub-optimal choice and causes burden shifts to other impact categories. Finally the ABM-based (bottom-up) approach is compared with a top-down approach applied in a previous study by the same authors to model the same system. Assets and drawbacks of the two approaches are highlighted. 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="Tidal power developments occurring in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia provide an informative case study of a natural resource management issue occurring in a coastal zone involving many stakeholders in several sectors. Research has shown that bridger organizations are important vehicles for forging connections and encouraging communication across sectoral boundaries in complex networks. Using a mixed-methods approach encompassing participatory mapping and social network analysis, this study examined stakeholder communication networks in the region, with a particular focus on identifying bridger organizations. The results show that communication within the tidal power network does cross sectors, and that bridger organizations are vital in connecting organizations across sectoral boundaries. Bridging activities are multifaceted with three distinct, yet complementary roles: coordinators, connectors, and information mediators. Numerous bridger organizations can co-exist within a network and they often specialize by working within specific sectors. Organizations from the NGO, research, and government sectors, in particular, feature prominently as bridgers within this network, in part because they are often seen as neutral brokers of information. By identifying the functions of bridgers and the sectors well-suited to perform these activities, this paper provides guidance to coastal and ocean managers, NGOs, government bodies, and research groups on where to deploy resources to support bridger organizations within natural resource development networks. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="Purpose: This paper aims to propose a knowledge transfer partnership (KTP) model, using higher education (HE) students researching in the UK. It is focused on community engagement via charitable trusts, New Opportunities Wirksworth (NOW) Ecclesbourne Valley Rail (EVR). The researchers designed and implemented a pilot study that explored the potential of a small, yet attractive and active, market town to diversify and regenerate using tourism. This project, which has been funded by the UK Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), has been devised to operate and monitor a KTP in the culturally important heritage market town of Wirksworth, in Derbyshire. Design/methodology/approach: A systems-thinking constructivist approach is used and employs problem-based learning (PBL) through engagement of students in research and data collection. The authors identified that skills for sustainable development within the community are dependent on the reintegration of complex, inter-dependent and inter-disciplinary factors. A holistic approach to the learning and knowledge shared within the community underpins UK initiatives to promote capacity development in ways to change knowledge applications across product and service boundaries. Therefore, in addition to encouraging diversification and regeneration through tourism, this project supported the University of Derby's academic agenda to promote experiential and entrepreneurial learning in students working at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This paper accords with the current university initiatives to meet the student employability agenda through the application of PBL and knowledge management. Findings: The creation of outcomes and recommendations for Wirksworth's stakeholders provides sustainability through the knowledge creation and sharing processes. There are seven outcomes that chart a path to development and knowledge transfer (KT) and sharing. The authors simultaneously provided an environment for students to gain skills and a community to acquire new knowledge, and these are the outcomes and output of this project. New learning styles may support inclusive academic practice (see related samples of PBL such as Ineson and Beresford in HLST resources 2001). Implications for building a KT community through the social capital accumulated in the project are explored. Originality/value: In taking PBL from the classroom to the community, the authors have created a new KT environment in which skills can be acquired and a regeneration strategy can be tested in a work-or-practice-related setting. Students recognise that they are building learning for themselves that is unique in that it cannot be recreated in a classroom setting. The authors see this project developing into a robust long-term partnership between communities and institutions with KT benefits to teaching staff in addition to students. These benefits will include new skills for PBL, working collaboratively with partners in the community to develop key skills in HE students, innovation in assessment, inclusive learning and teaching, experiential and entrepreneurial learning in practice.

At the theoretical/methodological level the paper contributes to the growing literature on the combination of systems methods by illustrating how conceptual models of purposeful human activity, a method intrinsic to SSM, were constructed from the participatory use of Concept Maps and Sign-graph Diagrams.

abstract="The tools and methods developed by different scientific communities to simulate the dynamics of land use have emphasised either processes or patterns of changes. Agent-based models (ABM) belong to the former category while many spatially explicit simulation models belong to the latter. These two different modelling approaches were jointly implemented at a study site in Vietnam to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses with respect to their capacity to support the formulation of land-use policy and to influence decision-making by multiple groups of stakeholders. SAMBA is a people-centred approach combining an ABM, a role-playing game and a geographic information system. Participatory simulations help elicit the rules of the ABM and calibrate the model, while the model supports the participatory exploration of land-use change scenarios over longer time periods. CLUE-s is a spatial simulation model which explores changes in land-use patterns within user-specified rules of permissible change and rates of change. Driving factors that influence changes from one land-use type to another are defined by combining spatially explicit data on land use and supposed driving factors in a logistical regression analysis. Alternatively, the decision rules that were revealed during the participatory simulations - with the role plays and the multi-agent modelling of the SAMBA approach - were incorporated in the CLUE-s model to provide more realistic estimates for the varying influence of land-use drivers. We checked the respective validity of the two models by applying them at the same site and comparing their outputs. As a result, no single approach was obviously superior according to the validation statistics. The three approaches turned out to be complementary in simulating land-use patterns, while providing different types of information. Integration of the two models into a rule-based version of CLUE-s helped reconciling data-driven statistical models and process-driven agent-based models in LUCC research. This new model reinforced the overall framework by facilitating the partnership between researchers from different scientific communities and between researchers and multiple groups of stakeholders. It may also better respond to the expectations of land users at different levels of the decision-making hierarchy. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Participatory modeling is particularly compatible with the rising focus on integrated water resources management, which incorporates systems theory and aims to protect and improve water resources while considering economic and social concerns in the community. In this article, we present a series of lessons based on experience working with stakeholder groups to develop watershed and water quality models to address water resource issues in Maryland, Vermont, Utah, and Virginia. We believe these lessons in participatory modeling, discussed from our perspective as scientists and modelers engaged in applied watershed issues, can help to achieve successful participatory modeling efforts elsewhere. The lessons relate to stakeholder engagement, modeling tools, model development and calibration, scenario testing, and applying results to management decisions. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract="This paper presents a participatory process, in the course of which stakeholders identified an implementable strategy for promoting renewable electricity generation in a county in Germany. In the process, a new combination of participatory methods was applied, including two participatory modeling approaches that are based on causal networks and the participatory development of qualitative normative scenarios. After the participatory process the combination of methods was evaluated regarding the ability to 1) map out the diversity of stakeholders' perspectives, 2) to grasp the complexity of the problem, 3) to make uncertainty of complex problems transparent and 4) to support the identification of implementable strategies. Evaluation results showed that the applied methods were able to fulfill criteria 1) to 3). Specifically, application of actor modeling lead to fulfillment of criteria 1) and 2), while normative scenario generation addressed criterion 3). Criterion 4) was only partly fulfilled due to lack of credibility of the Bayesian Network modeling results. This was caused by the high uncertainty of the conditional probabilities elicited from experts, as there is little empirical system knowledge in particular about the potential effects of management options. On the other hand, stakeholders were not sufficiently involved in the construction and application of Bayesian Network models during the participatory process. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this challenge, we introduce Tangible Landscape, an open-source participatory modeling tool providing an interactive, shared arena for consensus-building and development of collaborative solutions for landscape-scale problems. Using Tangible Landscape, stakeholders gather around a geographically realistic 3D visualization and explore management scenarios with instant feedback; users direct model simulations with intuitive tangible gestures and compare alternative strategies with an output dashboard. We applied Tangible Landscape to the complex problem of managing the emerging infectious disease, sudden oak death, in California and explored its potential to generate co-learning and collaborative management strategies among actors representing stakeholders with competing management aims. 2017 The Authors",

Framing integrated policies that improve their efficient use requires understanding the interdependencies in the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Stakeholder involvement in this process is crucial to represent multiple perspectives, ensure political legitimacy and promote dialogue. In this research, we develop and apply a participatory modelling approach to identify the main interlinkages within the WEF nexus in Andalusia, as a starting point to developing a system dynamic model at a later stage. The application of fuzzy cognitive mapping enabled us to gain knowledge on the WEF nexus according to opinions from 14 decision-makers, as well as contributing to raising awareness and building consensus among stakeholders. Results show that climate change and water availability are key drivers in the WEF nexus in Andalusia. Other variables with significant interlinkages within the WEF nexus are food production, irrigated agriculture, energy cost, socio-economic factors, irrigation water use, environmental conservation, and farm performance indicators. The scenario analysis reveals the interdependencies among nexus sectors and the existence of unanticipated effects when changing variables in the system, which need to be considered to design integrated policies. 2018 by the authors.",

The paper draws on a combination of lessons from literature and the case of a companion modelling process conducted in the context of a conflict about land and forest management in Northern Thailand. Using insights from negotiation theories, we analyze specifically the influence of spatial representations on the way people interacted, discussed and learnt from each other in the participatory modelling process. We argue that models that are spatially too explicit and realistic can actually impede the exploration of innovative and integrative scenarios in which ecological, social and economic objectives are mutually enriching. Indeed, spatial representations might lead to think in terms of boundaries and segregated space, and therefore prevent from thinking in terms of multifunctional space and from finding innovative and integrative solutions. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="New forms of governance that foster multi-level and collaborative action have been identified as key to climate change adaptation. Ecosystem-based adaptation is emerging as an important type of adaptation response. Despite its recognized promise, it remains a challenging task to conceptualize governance regimes for it because of the involvement of numerous actors across the landscape scale. Both multi-level and collaborative forms of governance are required to involve relevant actors in decision-making and related actions. We explore the applicability of the theory of nodal governance, in conjunction with social network theory, to provide a framework for operationalizing the concepts of multi-level and collaborative governance. We use the Bergrivier municipal area of South Africa as a case study, focusing on organizations (nodes) that have the potential to implement ecosystem-based adaptation. We show that a nodal governance focus on institutional structures, mentalities, technologies, and resources can be highly effective for understanding the factors supporting or constraining ecosystem-based adaptation. A focus on the number and strength of network connections that actors share highlights how the numerous connections between organizations constitute an important opportunity for strengthening ecosystem-based adaptation outcomes in the future. The analysis suggests that in the Bergrivier municipal area, both agricultural best practices and restoration activities are side-lined compared to other activities (e.g., land use planning) despite the importance of the agricultural sector in the Bergrivier area. We argue that a nodal governance focus, accompanied by the use of social network analysis, can be highly effective for understanding how to improve governance of adaptation at the local level. 2017, The Author(s).",

Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarises recent research findings on SO and self-transformation in communities using a combination of complexity approaches. It describes the methodological framework used to conduct action research about the self-transformation and learning of a European eco-community and reflects about the approaches used and lessons learned. Findings: This research confirms the complementarity between two approaches to complexity management: the viable systems model from S. Beer, a pioneering approach to managing complexity in institutions, and complex adaptive systems, a more recent approach to deal with SO in organisations. Mapping the organisational dynamics and the structural changes decided by the community members shows interesting insights about emergence and SO. This is a state-of-the-art research on multi-methodological approaches to support complexity management in organisations. Originality/value: As in many action research projects, early findings are limited to one particular organisation. Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks of the broader research are useful for a wide variety of organisations, both in terms of guiding organisational transformations and supporting networking management of networks collaborating to create more sustainable evolutionary pathways.

abstract="The management of solid waste at regional level has received considerable attention over the last years. Increased consumption levels are causing an exacerbation of the problem, whereas the sensitivity of the public over environmental issues makes its solution harder. Although the main difficulties in resolving the different occurrences of the problem belong to the realm of policy making, so far the employment of operational research and systems methods seems to adopt a purely technocratic stance, concentrating on the content and understating the solution process. In the different formulations of the problem as static optimization relating to the economics of the location of the treatment facilities and the methods and routes of waste transportation, the dynamics of the issue and the intervention activities are neglected, whereas cognitive and social perspectives of the solution process are objectified and over-rationalized. This paper aims at demonstrating how the solid waste management (SWM) problem and its solution process can be addressed in a more holistic way by adopting a multi-methodological point of view. Towards this end, we present the combined application of soft systems methodology, system dynamics and multi-objective optimization in an action research project for the development of an SWM system for a specific region in Greece. 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract="A sequential approach to combining two established modeling techniques (systems thinking and Bayesian Belief Networks; BBNs) was developed and applied to climate change adaptation research within the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQ-CARI). Six participatory workshops involving 66 stakeholders based within SEQ produced six system conceptualizations and 22 alpha-level BBNs. The outcomes of the initial systems modeling exercise successfully allowed the selection of critical determinants of key response variables for in depth analysis within more homogeneous, sector-based groups of participants. Using two cases, this article focuses on the processes and methodological issues relating to the use of the BBN modeling technique when the data are based on expert opinion. The study expected to find both generic and specific determinants of adaptive capacity based on the perceptions of the stakeholders involved. While generic determinants were found (e.g. funding and awareness levels), sensitivity analysis identified the importance of pragmatic, context-based determinants, which also had methodological implications. The article raises questions about the most appropriate scale at which the methodology applied can be used to identify useful generic determinants of adaptive capacity when, at the scale used, the most useful determinants were sector-specific. Comparisons between individual BBN conditional probabilities identified diverging and converging beliefs, and that the sensitivity of response variables to direct descendant nodes was not always perceived consistently. It was often the accompanying narrative that provided important contextual information that explained observed differences, highlighting the benefits of using critical narrative with modeling tools. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="Provision of urban water supplies to rapidly growing cities of South East Asia is difficult because of increasing demand for limited water supplies, periodic droughts, and depletion and contamination of surface and groundwater. In such adverse environments, effective policy and planning processes are required to secure adequate water supplies. Developing a Water Needs Index reveals key elements of the complex urban water supply by means of a participatory approach for rapid and interdisciplinary assessment. The index uses deliberative interactions with stakeholders to create opportunities for mutual understanding, confirmation of constructs and capacity building of all involved. In Can Tho City, located at the heart of the Mekong delta in Vietnam, a Water Needs Index has been developed with local stakeholders. The functional attributes of the Water Needs Index at this urban scale have been critically appraised. Systemic water issues, supply problems, health issues and inadequate, poorly functioning infrastructure requiring attention from local authorities have been identified. Entrenched social and economic inequities in access to water and sanitation, as well as polluting environmental management practices has caused widespread problems for urban populations. The framework provides a common language based on systems thinking, increased cross-sectoral communication, as well as increased recognition of problem issues; this ought to lead to improved urban water management. Importantly, the case study shows that the approach can help to overcome biases of local planners based on their limited experience (information black spots), to allow them to address problems experienced in all areas of the city. 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

abstract="There is a growing recognition among water resource managers that sustainable watershed management needs to not only account for the diverse ways humans benefit from the environment, but also incorporate the impact of human actions on the natural system. Coupled natural-human system modeling through explicit modeling of both natural and human behavior can help reveal the reciprocal interactions and co-evolution of the natural and human systems. This study develops a spatially scalable, generalized agent-based modeling (ABM) framework consisting of a process-based semi-distributed hydrologic model (SWAT) and a decentralized water system model to simulate the impacts of water resource management decisions that affect the food-water-energy-environment (FWEE) nexus at a watershed scale. Agents within a river basin are geographically delineated based on both political and watershed boundaries and represent key stakeholders of ecosystem services. Agents decide about the priority across three primary water uses: Food production, hydropower generation and ecosystem health within their geographical domains. Agents interact with the environment (streamflow) through the SWAT model and interact with other agents through a parameter representing willingness to cooperate. The innovative two-way coupling between the water system model and SWAT enables this framework to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on the environmental dynamics and vice versa. To support non-technical stakeholder interactions, a web-based user interface has been developed that allows for role-play and participatory modeling. The generalized ABM framework is also tested in two key transboundary river basins, the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and the Niger River basin in West Africa, where water uses for ecosystem health compete with growing human demands on food and energy resources. We present modeling results for crop production, energy generation and violation of eco-hydrological indicators at both the agent and basin-wide levels to shed light on holistic FWEE management policies in these two basins. 2017 Author(s).",

abstract="The social sustainability of cities is increasingly assisted by smart apps, social media and the awareness of how social interactions relate to urban space. Within cities, communities or neighbourhoods are no longer easily spatially defined. Similarly, how a community might govern itself does not necessarily follow traditional, simple, spatially self-contained loci. The role of housing management companies, managing a portfolio of social and private housing, adds additional complexity to relations between individual properties and their collective governance, at a level below that of the local municipality. Meanwhile, the advent of online crowdsourcing and crowdfunding poses new challenges about the influence of outsiders and 'who gets a vote'-and who uses their vote-when making decisions about a neighbourhood's future. This poses a number of challenges for planning and local democracy in the smarter city. This paper reports on new research from the Incubators of Public Spaces project, involving the use of a novel online design and crowdsourcing platform as an experimental tool for public participation, in the case of a London housing estate. In particular, this chapter analyses relationships between different actors and instruments involved in the governance of the different areas or territories of the housing estate. We report on the challenges of holistically engaging a focused yet diverse pool of users in the regeneration of a series of courtyards associated with social housing blocks. This involves non-trivial decisions about user access rights within the platform, which becomes a challenge of reinventing a micro-scale democracy.

abstract="Purpose: In response to the worlds rising awareness on sustainability, industry players and policymakers are devoting great efforts to bolster green building developments. Every green building project (GBP) involves numerous stakeholders and potentially incompatible concerns. Despite the associated environmental, economic and social benefits, GBP developments have often confronted managerial barriers which are actually emerged from stakeholders the actual key determinants of a project. Holistically analyzing the complexity of stakeholders in GBPs is, therefore, crucial to improving GBP management and achieving greater sustainability for all involved. The purpose of this paper is to analyze stakeholder complexity in large GBPs using a holistic framework which integrates both empirical and rationalistic analytical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: The complexity of stakeholders in GBPs can be considered from three aspects identifying stakeholders, assessing stakeholder interactions and analyzing stakeholder concerns. The proposed stakeholder analysis framework uses both empirical methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and rationalistic methods (e.g. chain referral sampling and social network analysis) to analyze GBP stakeholder complexity. Case study of a lab-enabled commercial GBP in Hong Kong was undertaken to illustrate the framework. Findings: The framework enables a holistic, objective and effective stakeholder analysis; leading GBP leaders toward a complete understanding of project stakeholder complexity. The case study findings bring managerial insights to GBP leaders on the general SNA-related stakeholder dynamics and the important stakeholder concerns, of large Hong Kong GBPs. The findings diagnose general connectivity structures of GBP stakeholders, identify influential and peripheral actors in GBP information exchange, and suggest clues to improve their dynamics. In addition, ten key stakeholder concerns were identified, including comprehensive governmental standards and procedures, clear sustainability goals at the outset, effective stakeholder engagement, adequate design flexibility, and a can-do attitude of contractors and consultants which are all vital for successful GBP development. The underlying reasons of these concerns and recommendations to addressing them were also discussed. Originality/value: Many existing GBP stakeholder studies appear to use a single analytical perspective to assess project stakeholder complexity, but this may not gain a full understanding. The holistic stakeholder analysis framework used herein combines empiricism and rationalism. It helps to bring GBP leaders and implementers toward a more informed project decision making, a more thorough understanding of stakeholder complexity, as well as a more effective engagement of stakeholders. 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

abstract="Landscape aesthetics provides humans with health and social benefits contributing to overall well-being, thus representing a cultural ecosystem service. Landscape biophysical and social attributes create information that is interpreted as either beauty or blight by the mind of the beholder. The ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) modelling platform is quite suited to the landscape aesthetics paradigm, since it is characterized by both a strong focus on the spatial connectivity between ecosystems and beneficiaries and by the employment of Bayesian networks to quantify and communicate uncertainty. A conceptual framework based on landscape aesthetic abstraction levels was proposed to build these Bayesian networks, progressively linking tangible indicators to abstract dimensions and concepts. As input to ARIES, a simple and rapid participatory methodology was designed to weight indicators according to stakeholder preferences, from which values the probabilities were derived for use in canonical probabilistic models. The participatory indicator identification methodology generated both abstract and concrete terms, suggesting that the process should be supervised to obtain clear and tangible indicators. A sensitivity analysis revealed that individual visual blight indicators had more profound impacts on landscape aesthetic while the effect of beauty indicators was more subtle and balanced. Although the methodology may require a relatively large number of participants to derive probabilities, the procedure was not overly challenging for the participants. This methodology has the potential to be implemented widely, in various contexts and for different periods, accounting for alternative spatiotemporal variations and land cover contexts. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Government permission for smallholder farmers to extract and sell resin from a pine savanna biosphere-reserve in Mexico has settled a long dispute among different stakeholders in the short-term; however, forest production and conservation beyond 20 years are compromised due to low pine recruitment caused by competition with exotic grasses. Grass control practiced by farmers through grazing and fire has previously been discouraged by conservation authorities, which inadvertently limits long-term pine conservation and use. We describe the participatory design, rationale and simulation attributes of an educational, interactive, agent-based model that explores suites of management options and their economic and ecological outputs. We present and analyze the outcomes of four simulation workshops, where farmers and external-actors better grasped the complex ecological interactions involved in conserving and using pines in grazed pine savanna with exotic grasses, and discussed these findings with a long-term vision and tradeoff analysis approach. 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="Sustainable and responsive water management policies are essential to provide high-quality, reasonably priced drinking water to consumers at any time, while simultaneously ensuring a profit for the water utility. Such goal can be typically achieved through two different types of policy, namely increasing water supply, or managing water demand; the latter can be performed, among others, through water pricing. Pricing, especially when demand-based, can lead to a behavioural change in customer water use, but it is arduous to introduce for a number of political and social reasons; it is essential to engage with relevant stakeholders to clearly recognize pros and cons of implementing a new water tariff. As a consequence, in this paper, economic and social implications of demand-based tariff structures, and their potential for greater water conservation, are assessed through a participatory approach. The variation of residential water demand and revenue outcomes were simulated through an integrated participatory systems approach by assuming that an inclining block tariff was introduced on the Gold Coast region, Australia. Such connection between price, demand, and revenue is highly complex and the choice of System Dynamics for this modelling exercise is considered ideal as it can explicitly handle the non-linearity, feedbacks and interconnections of such system. The simulation model was developed by collaborating with relevant stakeholders, thus ensuring the logical inclusion of all the relevant inputs and connections. Such model integrates three components, namely revenue forecasting; water billing; and demand feedback sub-model. The results show that: a) the inclining block tariff can effectively lead to behavioural change and water consumption reduction, especially within the high water users group, although the predicted water savings would be lower than when adopting water restrictions; b) customers feedback to an increased cost can be used to achieve revenue neutrality; c) based on customer feedback and modelling simulations, the ideal proportion of customers to be charged with the second block tariff is 20{\%}, however this can be recalculated and varied during wet seasons or dry seasons to optimise water availability. The developed model allows water planners to explore a wide range of policy alternatives (e.g. alternative pricing scenarios to influence demand) over medium to long-term periods and to optimise best-practice decision making for urban water conservation and management. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

We here present Tinamit, a novel tool to couple SD and physically-based models in a rapid, reproducible, and stakeholder-friendly manner. Tinamit requires only a few lines of Python code to couple and simulate models (or, with its interface, no coding at all), which is expected to make model coupling more accessible to stakeholders and allow them to continue developing coupled models after the end of a funded project. We use Tinamit to couple a SD-based farmer economics model from Pakistan with a soil salinity model (SAHYSMOD) and analyze the trade-offs of various policies, of which canal lining with subsidies seemed promising. Such results cannot be readily obtained from either model alone. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="There is an increasing consensus on the importance of coupling ecosystem services (ES) into integrated water resource management (IWRM), due to a wide range of benefits to human from the ES. This paper proposes an ESbased IWRM framework within which a participatory Bayesian network (BN) model is developed to assist with the coupling between ES and IWRM. The framework includes three steps: identifying water-related services of ecosystems; analysis of the tradeoff and synergy among users of water; and ES-based IWRM implementation using the participatory BN model. We present the development, evaluation and application of the participatory BN model with the involvement of four participant groups (stakeholders, water manager, water management experts, and research team) in Qira oasis area, Northwest China. As a typical catchment-scale region, the Qira oasis area is facing severe water competition between the demands of human activities and natural ecosystems. Results demonstrate that the BN model developed provides effective integration of ES into a quantitative IWMR framework via public negotiation and feedback. The network results, sensitivity evaluation, and management scenarios are broadly accepted by the participant groups. The intervention scenarios from the model conclude that any water management measure remains unable to sustain the ecosystem health in water-related ES. Greater cooperation among the stakeholders is highly necessary for dealing with such water conflicts. In particular, a proportion of the agricultural water saved through improving water-use efficiency should be transferred to natural ecosystems via water trade. The BN model developed is appropriate for areas throughout the world in which there is intense competition for water between human activities and ecosystems. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

abstract="Following the Integrated Water Resources Management approach, the European Water Framework Directive demands Member States to develop water management plans at the catchment level. Those plans have to integrate the different interests and must be developed with stakeholder participation. To face these requirements, managers need tools to assess the impacts of possible management alternatives on natural and socio-economic systems. These tools should ideally be able to address the complexity and uncertainties of the water system, while serving as a platform for stakeholder participation. The objective of our research was to develop a participatory integrated assessment model, based on the combination of a crop model, an economic model and a participatory Bayesian network, with an application in the middle Guadiana sub-basin, in Spain. The methodology is intended to capture the complexity of water management problems, incorporating the relevant sectors, as well as the relevant scales involved in water management decision making. The integrated model has allowed us testing different management, market and climate change scenarios and assessing the impacts of such scenarios on the natural system (crops), on the socio-economic system (farms) and on the environment (water resources). Finally, this integrated assessment modelling process has allowed stakeholder participation, complying with the main requirements of current European water laws. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="The traditional approaches to resolving urban stormwater problems include costly expansion of collections systems and/or creation of in-line storage and treatment capacity. An emerging 'green' infrastructure (GI) approach would instead reduce runoff sources. An agent-based model is used to explore the spatiotemporal emergence of rain gardens and green roofs in Point Breeze, a 175 ha neighbourhood in South Philadelphia, PA, under two different scenarios. In the first, household GI adoption rules consider only economic self-interest and the physical compatibility of each GI technology with lot characteristics. In the second scenario, the adoption rules are enhanced based on insights into the possible behaviour of property owners, as intuited by the designers/authors over a two-year period using a variety of empirical methods. In Scenario 2, relevant knowledge and perceptions are transferred to household decision-makers through social networks, and exposure to GI is assumed to diffuse GI innovation. The two scenarios differ in the temporal rate of GI adoption in the neighbourhood at large (greater in Scenario 1), as well as in the spatial influence of early adopters in Scenario 2, underscoring the importance of stakeholder decisions in the ultimate the effectiveness of watershed-scale GI programs. 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

abstract="Complex ecosystems, such as the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), present major management challenges. Such systems often provide a range of ecosystem services that are differentially valued by stakeholders representing distinct interests (e.g., agriculture, conservation, navigation) or institutions (e.g., federal and state agencies). When no single entity has the knowledge or authority to resolve conflicts over shared resource use, stakeholders may struggle to jointly understand the scope of the problem and to reach reasonable compromises. This paper explores mediated modeling as a group consensus building process for understanding relationships between ecological, economic and cultural well-being in the UMR floodplain. We describe a workshop structure used to engage UMR stakeholders that may be extended to resource use conflicts in other complex ecosystems. We provide recommendations for improving on these participatory methods in structuring future efforts. In conclusion, we suggest that tools which facilitate collaborative learning, such as mediated modeling, need to be incorporated at an institutional level as a vital element of integrated ecosystem management. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper summarises a participatory framework through which decision-makers, experts and system modellers can collaboratively develop an integrated model to support such decisions. A feasibility study showed the potential of the framework. An operational version of the model, able to analyse the effects of 50 management options on 20 indicators, is estimated to require in the order of 225 man-months from system modellers, alongside substantial inputs from stakeholders. The significant technical challenges confronting such an exercise may be overshadowed by the institutional challenges, including the fundamental question of whether organisations are truly committed. However, the reward for overcoming such challenges is the opportunity to achieve genuine improvements in the social, economic and environmental quality of our catchments. 2010 The Authors.

abstract="Dynamic systems are systems within which changes occur all the time. Such systems are organisations, innovation projects, etc. It is a well-known fact that interaction and commitment from a range of professions is needed to achieve competitive results in product development projects. Especially when innovative development is carried out, it is of the utmost importance that product developers interact intensively in every link from sub-suppliers to customers, users and society if they are not to lose important signals from any part of the chain or be unaware of important and unforeseen events that will inevitably take place during a development process. Dealing with product development therefore means dealing with complex adaptive systems for which unpredictability increases with the number of people involved and the longer the development process takes. As a consequence, researchers must consider different approaches to research in order to improve their knowledge of practical product development and to produce useful theories for practitioners acting in a dynamic world. This paper deals with such considerations. One conclusion is that the most information-intense situation is reached if researchers act as project leaders of product development projects, which is called performing Participation or Insider Action Research (IAR). This line of action does, however, present a complication in that performing IAR often demands that researchers have some practical industrial experience in advance. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract="Sustainable management of coastal systems requires an iterative process using a multidisciplinary approach that integrates the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection, social progress and economic growth. The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure for an Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) process with an effective science-policy interface that embraces the challenge of simulating complex systems and encapsulates citizen involvement from the onset. We analysed the findings of 16 re-analyses studies undertaken in eight Baltic Sea countries to test how well SAF elements had been applied in practice within ICM processes. The results revealed the main ICM driver was ecology or economy. Several ICM elements as defined by the SAF are already standard within the Baltic Sea region. However, in many cases, the omission of stakeholder and institutional mapping as instructed by the SAF led to an unbalanced participation of stakeholders, or in some cases, lack of involvement of stakeholders at the start of the process. Most of the ICM processes failed to include an integrated, cross-sectorial, ecological-socio-economic assessment. This extends from the lack of system thinking when defining the Policy Issue for the problem and when developing the conceptual model, which often leads to one-sectorial solutions, which may not be sustainable. Furthermore, the duration of some of the ICM processes was prolonged due to disagreement and opposition early in the process and/or lack of manager experiences in conducting a stakeholder participatory process. Finally, due to its stringent structure the SAF was found to be a suitable quality assurance for sustainable ICM processes. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

The developed model focuses on adding the fleet perspective to the perception of assets in an industrial setting. Advanced prognosis and optimization technology combined with a partly centralized and de-centralized management of assets may be able to improve the reliability and the operational performance of the process industry in the future. The main contribution of this paper is the application of the fleet approach for assets in the process industry. The developed model utilizes experience and knowledge from different stakeholders. A holistic view of fleets in the process industry is given.

First, an individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="Multiagent-based simulation (MABS) is a very active interdisciplinary area bridging multiagent research and social science. The key technology to conduct truly useful MABS is agent modeling for reproducing realistic behaviors. In order to make agent models realistic, it seems natural to learn from human behavior in the real world. The challenge presented in this paper is to obtain an individual behavior model by using participatory modeling in the traffic domain. We show a methodology that can elicit prior knowledge for explaining human driving behavior in specific environments, and then construct a driving behavior model based on the set of prior knowledge. In the real world, human drivers often perform unintentional actions, and occasionally, they have no logical reason for their actions. In these cases, we cannot rely on prior knowledge to explain them. We are forced to construct a behavior model with an insufficient amount of knowledge to reproduce the driving behavior. To construct such individual driving behavior model, we take the approach of using knowledge from others to complement the lack of knowledge from the target. To clarify that the behavior model including prior knowledge from others offers individuality in driving behavior, we experimentally confirm that the driving behaviors reproduced by the hybrid model correlate reasonably well with human behavior. 2006 IEEE.",

abstract="The aim of providing affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all requires an in-depth understanding of the issues that affect energy access and energy fuel choice, particularly as related to urban informal settlements or slums. Within unequal societies, such as South Africa, a reliance on technical solutions to address access and inequality is inadequate, leading to resistance and protest. Further, introduction of a technical solution such as solar PV - to address energy access in urban informal settlements, is a complex process, and requires a systems thinking perspective. Using Community Based System Dynamics modelling, this paper therefore investigated the issues that affect energy fuel choice and energy access as related to the introduction of a renewable energy solution in Enkanini informal settlement. Different energy user groups were engaged in the identification of the factors that affect energy access and energy fuel choice; the relationships between these factors in order to improve future interventions; and development of causal loop diagrams to visualise the key feedback loops. The identified factors were economic and market related such as affordability, availability, and land ownership but also included a range of socio-political aspects. 17 feedback loops emerged, of which 13 were reinforcing loops, and 4 were balancing loops. The key feedback loops relate to community empowerment and representation, whilst participation in the political process and the quest for legitimacy through direct electricity connections were recognised as broader issues to be addressed. 2019 International Energy Initiative",

abstract="Growing awareness of the multiple environmental impacts of livestock production has created a need to extend the definition of efficiency to a multidimensional eco-efficiency concept. Our paper proposes an original methodology, named ``simulation based DEA'' that combines an agronomic whole-farm model and an efficient frontier method for in-depth exploration of the determinants of eco-efficiency. GAMEDE, the whole-farm model we use, is randomly parameterized for key management practices and structural parameters to generate a large dataset of simulated dairy systems. The upper and lower bounds set for the stochastic choice of parameter values are a key point in the methodology and rely on expert knowledge derived from participatory modelling. For each simulation, numerous indicators describing the functioning and the performance of the production system are calculated and a set of inputs, outputs, and undesirable outputs, are then used to define the production technology in an efficiency frontier analysis. Data envelopment analysis, the efficiency frontier method applied, provides a multidimensional eco-efficiency score representing the increase in outputs that is possible with no increase in inputs or undesirable outputs. The eco-efficiency score can be linked to all the indicators of the production system calculated by the whole-farm model, after which it becomes possible to explore the managerial, structural, economic, agronomic, zootechnical, and environmental factors that explain different levels of eco-efficiency. In our case study, dairy farming in Reunion Island, livestock production is strongly constrained by land scarcity. Consequently the most eco-efficient farms appear to be intensive systems with high forage productivity to ensure feed self-sufficiency. While most studies on efficiency are restricted to a narrow dataset, the proposed methodology is innovative in that it makes it possible to cover a wide range of possible livestock farming systems in a given territory, including systems that do not exist at the present time, and to characterize them using multiple descriptive variables, at a limited cost in time and in the cost of surveys. Coupling whole-farm models and efficiency frontier analysis is a promising way to accurately identify the determinants of eco-efficiency and ecological intensification pathways. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

This is the case of the Alto-Tiete watershed, the urban catchment encompassing the Sao Paulo metropolis in Brazil. The dynamic pattern of peri-urban areas characterised by rapid major changes has led to complex management issues in which the quantity and quality dimensions of water are intertwined. Effective participation of a broad spectrum of stakeholders supposes that actors from different technical backgrounds have a better understanding of the social and biophysical interactions of the system concerned. This paper describes the role of participatory modelling and simulation as a way to provide a meaningful framework to enable actors to understand the interdependencies in peri-urban catchment management. A role-playing game, connecting the quantitative and qualitative dynamics of the resources with social interactions at catchment level, was developed and tested with members of the catchment committee. Monitoring of the sessions underlined the role of such a tool in learning about collective water management.",

abstract="Critical barriers to adaptation to climate change include the timely detection and agreed definition of problems requiring adaptive action. In the context of local scale coastal management in north-western Europe, challenges to problem detection and identification are exacerbated by the diffuse nature of administrative, sectoral, and legal rights and other professional governance obligations. Yet, if adaptation is to progress in a manner that is both locally legitimate and in accord with national policies, climate signals must be detected and climate impact problems framed in similar ways by two key groups; local scale 'bottom-up' experts and decision makers, and national scale 'top-down' scientists and policy makers. With reference to case study sites in Ireland and Scotland, we employ participatory modelling with coastal stakeholders using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to trial its potential in measuring and assessing stakeholder perceptions of climate vulnerability both individually and collectively. We found that FCM not only offers insight into the existing detection and framing of climate signals in coastal decision making but also provides a structured communication platform from which climate problems might be coherently integrated into future coastal management deliberations as the adaptation process matures. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="Water pricing is regarded as the most important and simplest economic instrument to encourage more efficient use of irrigation water in crop production. In the extremely water-scarce Tarim River basin in northwest China, improving water use efficiency has high relevance for research and policy. A Bayesian network modeling approach was applied, which is especially suitable under data-scarce conditions and the complex geo-hydrological, socioeconomic, and institutional settings of the study region, as it allows the integration of data from various types of sources. The transdisciplinary approach aimed at understanding the actual water pricing practices, the shortcomings of the current system, and possible ways of improvement. In an iterative procedure of expert interviews and group workshops, the key factors related to water pricing and water use efficiency were identified. The interactions among specific factors were defined by the respective experts, generating a causal network, which describes all relevant aspects of the investigated system. This network was finally populated with probabilistic relationships through a second round of expert interviews and group discussions. The Bayesian modeling exercise was then conducted using Netica software. The modeling results show that the mere increase of water price does not lead to significant increases in water use efficiency in crop production. Additionally, the model suggests a shift to volumetric water pricing, subsidization of water saving irrigation technology, and advancing agricultural extension to enable the farmer to efficiently react to increased costs for water. The applied participatory modeling approach helped to stimulate communication among relevant stakeholders from different domains in the region, which is necessary to create mutual understanding and joint targeted action. Finally, the challenges related to the applied transdisciplinary Bayesian modeling approach are discussed in the Chinese context. 2015 by the authors.",

abstract="This paper explores the need to combine analytic understanding and experiential engagement in communication on social-ecological systems futures. Humans use two distinct mental modes to deal with salient information: analytic processing and experiential processing. Tools combining both modes of processing can help societal actors seeking to stimulate active and informed environmental governance to facilitate both understanding of and engagement with social-ecological systems. In this paper, we combine two tools, each geared to one mode of communication. The System Perspectives Scope is a tool aimed at eliciting and sharing analytic perspectives on social-ecological systems change. ScenarioCommunities facilitates the communication of perspectives on the future in an engaging experiential mode. We applied these two tools in two scenario workshops in Oxfordshire. Each workshop featured the tools in a different order to compare the effects across tools. The System Perspectives Scope was able to elicit participants' analytic perspectives and let them reflect on the systems they described. ScenarioCommunities communicated animated scenario storyline segments in a vivid and engaging experiential mode. This stimulated participants to create individual, experiential perspectives on the scenarios. The workshop that started with experiential engagement yielded reinforcing effects of the first tool on the second. This study shows that analytic and experiential communication can be used to generate both understanding of and engagement with social-ecological systems change. The study also indicates that the social-ecological systems frame used to develop these tools entails that they offer complementary advantages when compared to tools used in participatory landscape ecology and participatory modeling. 2012.",

abstract="Scenario development methods get to grips with taking a long-term view on complex issues such as climate change through involvement of stakeholders. Many of the recent (global) scenario exercises have been structured according to a Story-and-Simulation approach. Although elaborately studied, conceptual and practical issues remain in linking qualitative stories and quantitative models. In this paper, we show how stakeholders can directly estimate model parameter values using a three-step approach called Fuzzy Set Theory. We focus on the effect of multiple iterations between stories and models. Results show that we were successful in quickly delivering stakeholder-based quantification of key model parameters, with full consistency between linguistic terms used in stories and numeric values. Yet, values changed strongly from one iteration to the next. A minimum of two and preferably at least three iterations is needed to harmonise stories and models. We conclude that the application of Fuzzy Set Theory enabled a highly valuable, structured and reproducible process to increase consistency between stories and models, but that future work is needed to show its true potential, particularly related to the effect of iterations. Additionally, the number of tools that need to be applied in a short period of time to execute a Story-And-Simulation approach introduces drawbacks that need to be studied. However, an approach such as Story-And-Simulation is indispensable and effective in marrying the perspectives of scientists and other stakeholders when studying complex systems and complex problems. 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

Discrete event simulation and group support both appear to have clear promises in embedding soft OR principles, yet also contain limitations. Furthermore, simulation and group support appear to be complementary, balancing each other's limitations. Therefore, the combination of group support and discrete event simulation seems to be a fruitful vehicle for the application of soft OR principles. Through experiences in a case study at the cargo department of a major airline, we examine how collaborative simulation can be applied in practice as problem structuring method. We conclude that collaborative simulation has definite potential as a soft OR technique, but further research is required to speed up different steps of simulation to fully use simulation in interactive decision making sessions with multiple stakeholders. 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract="The rapid global growth in aquaculture, described as a blue revolution, has demanded new modes of market governance along long international value-chains. In large part this governance has been built on an expanding framework of voluntary industry-led standards, though latterly these standards have drawn some criticism. Such criticism has largely centred on (i) a crisis of trust, related to (ii) the closed development of these standards by a powerful few, and (iii) a relatively narrow framing of sustainability according to techno-scientific, best-practice criteria. This article introduces the SEAT research project, which sought to address these criticisms by co-producing indices of sustainable aquaculture indicators according to top-down inputs from scientific, government and industry experts, and bottom-up inputs from aquaculture stakeholders along the value-chains. It particularly focuses on how the project elicited these bottom-up indicators through inclusive workshops with aquaculture stakeholders, drawing on concepts and approaches from practical ethics. It describes and evaluates the approach in one particular workshop with Bangladeshi shrimp and prawn stakeholders, and in so doing seeks to make methodological contributions to on-going debates on how to affect participatory aquaculture governance. The experience highlighted the potential difficulty in assembling a truly diverse group of stakeholders, but did demonstrate the potential of value-ranking and scenario exercises for mobilising a rich store of knowledge for the bottom-up construction of standards, as an important compliment to expert-led top-down initiatives. Workshop participants themselves emphasised the workshops as a unique opportunity for learning about the different framings of sustainability along the value-chain, and urged facilitators to emulate the workshops more widely, from the farm-scale to the global scale. 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

These results were produced using Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a bottom-up and participatory mixed methods-based approach. The results include a multivariate estimated concept map comprising 54 drivers spatially distributed across eight interrelated clusters. The spatial organization of clusters on the concept map provides insights on their interrelatedness and conceptual configuration which reveal stakeholders concept breadth and depth of novel biomass value chains. Moreover, the relative importance and relative feasibility measures for each cluster of drivers were obtained. These measures indicate significant statistical differences between perceived relative importance and feasibility ratings. A discussion compares the results with available empirical evidence to further interpret the interrelatedness of the clusters, and provide additional insights regarding effective policy formulation for enabling novel biomass-based value chains. 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="This paper considers participatory modelling to integrate biodiversity conservation into land use planning and to facilitate the incorporation of ecological knowledge into public decision making for spatial planning. Reunion Island has experienced rapid urban and agricultural expansion, which threaten its unique biodiversity. In this context, we designed three participatory modelling sequences, involving overall 24 multidisciplinary researchers and stakeholders. The sequences aimed: (1) to map land-use and biodiversity, (2) to develop a conservation plan following systematic conservation planning principles using a spatial optimization tool (MARXAN) and (3) to simulate coupled land-use/conservation scenarios using a multi-agent system (MAS). The conservation plan confirms that priority areas for biodiversity protection are located on the coast where rapid land-use changes occur. Nevertheless, stakeholders from the urban and agricultural sector did not participate to this sequence. Indeed, conservation planning tools are useful to locate conservation priorities but they have to be designed with stakeholders to be accepted as negotiation tool. Besides, the researchers engaged in this second sequence were perceived as conservation stakeholders rather than holders of scientific knowledge. In the third sequence, the researchers involved adopted the stance of facilitating the elicitation of each stake and gathered trust from stakeholders. Overall, we conclude that the participatory development of land-use simulation models should be promoted to explore alternative scenarios for biodiversity conservation with stakeholders. In a situation of land-use conflict, a gradual and sequential participatory modelling approach should be implemented to fit into public decision-making processes. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="Participatory methods provide an increasingly accepted path to integrated water assessment. This research describes an interdisciplinary exercise of scenario design and modelling, which provides a methodology to couple hard science numerical modelling approaches with the involvement of key water actors and socioeconomic issues. A decision support system based on probabilistic methods (Bayesian networks) is the tool chosen for dealing with the interdisciplinary issues involved in this aquifer. Given the long-standing conflicts in the area, modelling work largely focuses on carrying out an impact assessment produced by different scenarios established under the light of the mandatory objectives established by the European Union Water Framework Directive. This methodology is applied to a semi-arid aquifer located in SE Spain (Serral-Salinas) that represents an extreme case of intensive groundwater use. Irrigation has been a catalyst for welfare in the area for the past 40 years, despite the resulting large groundwater drawdown and continuous rise of groundwater pumping energy costs. Modelling results suggest that only a drastic change in the abstraction regime can produce a solution to long term sustainability of the aquifers. In addition, the impact assessment advises that such objectives are unlikely to be met due to the high economic costs of this action. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

abstract="This transdisciplinary research case study sought to disrupt the usual ways public participation shapes future energy systems. An interdisciplinary group of academics and a self-assembling public of a North English town co-produced bottom-up visions for a future local energy system by emphasizing local values, aspirations and desires around energy futures. The effects of participatory modelling are considered as part of a community visioning process on participants social learning and social capital. This paper examines both the within-process dynamics related to models and the impact of the outside process, political use of the models by the participants. Both a numerical model (to explore local electricity generation and demand) and a physical scale model of the town were developed to explore various aspects of participants visions. The case study shows that collaborative visioning of local energy systems can enhance social learning and social capital of communities. However, the effect of participatory modelling on these benefits is less clear. Tensions arise between inspiring and empowering role of visions. It is argued that the situatedness of the visioning processes needs to be recognized and integrated within broader aspects of governance and power relations. 2016 The Author(s).

abstract="Agent-based modeling is used for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous entities aiming to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. At an abstract level, an agent-based model (ABM) is a representation of the many simple agents and interactions among them. The decision making of the agents is based on the rules given to them. In an ABM, the model output is the result of internal decision-making and may differ with alteration in the decision path. On the contrary, with the set of rules embedded in agents, their behavior is modeled to take a certain action in a certain situation. It suggests that the internal decision making behavior of agents is truly responsible for the model output and thus it cannot be ignored while validating ABMs. This research article focuses on the validating agents behavior by evaluating decision-making processes of agents. For this purpose, we propose a validation framework based on a participatory simulation game. Using this framework we engage a human player (i.e. a domain stakeholder) to allow us to collect information about choices and validate the behavior of an individual agent. A proof-of-concept game is developed for a city logistics ABM to test the framework. 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

abstract="The future of the agriculture in mountain areas constitutes an important stake for sustainable development in relation to landscape functions and their role in local economies. This future depends highly on its ability to develop innovative and multifunctional agricultural systems and to preserve its attractiveness for future generations. Encroachment and reforestation of landscapes, which comes from land abandonment and extensification of land use, raise important topical issues. In Pyrenean valleys, where the land is colonised by the ash tree (Fraxinus excelsior), local land managers and policy-makers want to understand better the relationships between the ecological and social processes in order to assist in the design of policies supporting constructive change. Here we present the companion modelling approach in which we are all together constructing a simulation model for carrying out a prospective study of land use and landscape changes in the region. According to the principles of this participatory approach, we started developing a spatialised multi-agent model, whose main conceptual aspects are presented here below. The model simulates the evolution of land cover of the agricultural landscape in relation to both the natural and anthropogenic dynamics. Ecological field studies having stressed the role of mowing and grazing practices at the parcel level on colonisation of the local landscape by the ash tree, we focus on the account of prospective change in farmers land management practices (viewed as a set of decision rules) and their impact. This ongoing study underlines the interest of spatially explicit modelling of the inter-relationships between social and ecological dynamics at the agricultural landscape scale based on an interdisciplinary approach for dealing with rural development topical issues. Both the advantages gained and the difficulties raised are discussed. 2008, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

abstract="Public participation has become an important driver in increasing public acceptance of policy decisions, especially in the forestry sector, where conflicting interests among the actors are frequent. Stakeholder Analysis, complemented by Social Network Analysis techniques, was used to support the participatory process and to understand the complex relationships and the strong interactions among actors. This study identifies the forestry training sector stakeholders in the Western Italian Alps and describes their characteristics and priorities, in relation to training activities on entrepreneurial topics for forestry loggers. The hierarchy among actors has been identified, highlighting their respective roles and influence in decision-making processes. A lack of mutual communication among different and well-separated categories of actors has been identified, while good connections between stakeholders, operating in different territories, despite the presence of administrative and logistical barriers, have been observed. Training is a topic involving actors with different roles and interests. Nevertheless, all actors consider training about how to improve yields of forest operations and how to assess investments, particularly in innovative machinery, to be crucially important and conducive to a better comprehension of the wood supply chain and the enhancement of the raw material. 2018 by the authors.",

abstract="Food systems will need to undergo considerable transformation. To be better prepared for and resilient to uncertainty and disturbances in the future, resource users and managers need to further develop knowledge about the food and farming system, with its dominating feedback structures and complexities, and to test robust and integrated system-based solutions. This paper investigates how participatory system dynamics modeling can be adapted to groups at the community level with low or no formal educational background. The paper also analyses the refinement of workshop participants mental models as a consequence of a participatory system dynamics intervention. For this purpose, we ran two workshops with small-scale farmers in Zambia. Analysis of workshop data and post-workshop interviews shows that participatory system dynamics is well adaptable to support an audience-specific learning-by-doing approach. The use of pictures, objects and water glasses in combination with the basic aspects of causal loop diagramming makes for a well-balanced toolbox. Participants acquire understanding that is also relevant beyond systems thinking in that it offers a range of practical insights such as a critical evaluation of common food security strategies. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

abstract="The literature suggests that increasing stakeholder engagement has a positive impact on projects using discrete-event simulation in healthcare. This suggests projects should strive to involve the stakeholders in as much of the project as possible, through facilitated workshops. A notable gap in stakeholder involvement is the model coding stage, in which a conceptual model is turned into a discrete-event simulation model running on a computer. This paper investigates how and under what circumstances model coding might also be conducted in facilitated workshops, in particular through the use of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modelling standard. This work arose from a series of modelling projects with two hospitals, one in Italy and the other in the UK. The paper describes how BPMN can contribute, with a case in which model coding was achieved in a facilitated workshop and a second in which it was not but which highlights further barriers to this in some contexts. These barriers arise from the detail necessary for requisite modelling regarding (i) the level of complexity of the model and (ii) challenges in data access and analysis to populate the model. The relationship between the technical capabilities of tools available and the impact of these barriers is also discussed. We believe this is the first time that discrete-event simulation model coding in a facilitated workshop in healthcare has been described, and we provide a clear view of the further barriers. To indicate when facilitated model coding is currently achievable, we suggest a contextual matrix. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

A case study from the Adayar watershed, Chennai, is provided as an example of how SSM can be used to understand complex situations and as a problem-solving strategy for flood management. Flat topography, uncontrolled urban development, population growth, sand bar formation at the river mouth and low tidal action render complexity to flood management in Chennai. For effective flood management, a participatory and integrated approach, which includes stakeholders in the decision-making process and an enabling institutional set-up, is essential. As part of an integrated approach, the relationship between various organizations and the public is identified. SSM is an approach for addressing fuzzy problematic situations involving human activity. In this paper, SSM techniques like 'Rich Picture Diagrams' and 'CATWOE analysis' and participatory action research tools like 'pairwise ranking' and 'force field analysis' were investigated. Two workshops were conducted to define and explore the problematic situation, the role of various actors involved in the problem, to develop the conceptual model, to rank decision-making criteria, and to analyse the forces for and against to solve the problem.

This approach evaluates long-term plans using the cost of delivered electricity, resource mix, jobs and economic stimulus created within communities, and decentralized generation mix of the system, with results provided in a spatially-resolved format. This approach complements existing electricity planning methods (e.g., Integrated Resource Planning) by offering novel evaluation criteria based on typical stakeholder preferences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with a case study based on a blank-slate scenario, which begins without generation or transmission infrastructure, for the long-term rural renewable energy plans of Liberia, West Africa. We consider five electrification strategies: prioritizing larger populations, deploying large resources, creating jobs, providing economic stimulus, and step-wise cost minimization. Through the case study we demonstrate how this approach can be used to engage stakeholders, supplement more established energy planning tools, and illustrate the effects of stakeholder decisions and preferences on the performance of the system. 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

The practice of information technology (IT) development does not indicate a lack of problems in spite of the growing number of modeling techniques. This article gives an action research account of formulating and applying a new business process modeling framework to manufacturing processes to guide software development. It is based on a combination of soft systems methodology (SSM) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) business process modeling extensions suggested by Eriksson and Penker. SSM has been linked to information systems provision in the past. The examination of prior research shows that there is no underlying reasoning about the justification from a methodological point of view of the combination of SSM and UML. This article justifies the mixing of SSM and Eriksson and Penker's UML extensions using the ideas of Mingers' Multimethodology. The latter helps to overcome the ontological complexities of combining soft and hard techniques in a single intervention. The proposed framework was applied to modeling the production process in an aluminum rolling plant as a step in the development of a new information system for it. The reflections on the intervention give details on how actual learning and appreciation is facilitated using SSM, leading to better UML models in this complex problem. 2007, IGI Global.",

abstract="This paper proposes a new conceptual design tool for bioenergy systems, the 2MBio, and its implementation on the case of wood fuel energy systems (WES) in South Mozambique. Dependence on wood fuel characterises most Sub-Saharan countries and WES are complex socio-ecological systems dynamically linked to crucial development issues, e.g., deforestation and poverty. In Mozambique WES supply over 70{\%} of the national energy needs through an informal business network worth around one million euros each year. In contrast with the 2MBio, currently available tools often aim at supporting decision-making on WES with off-the-shelf expert solutions and optimisation of WES efficiency, supply chains and resource management. While relevant and useful, such approaches are frequently unsuitable to engage the knowledge and creativity of a wide range of crucial actors. The 2MBio addresses this gap providing a simple, visual platform on paper that supports from illiterate to professional users, to stimulate creative ideas and apply current knowledge while designing their own WES. The results of implementation in real settings in South Mozambique produced relevant design breakthroughs. Compared with the absence of any other support tool, and faced with same design challenges, the 2MBio participatory design workshops in south Mozambique resulted in comprehensive analysis of wood fuel energy systems, and innovative integrated WES solutions design. The proposed approach raised participants awareness about opportunities and constrains linked to their WES while also facilitating information sharing new learning dynamics and enhance creativity. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

The aim of the study was to identify stumbling blocks to the adaptive management of fire and to test whether this could be done using participatory methods and a systems modelling tool called Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). Results from the case study indicate that the participatory system analysis approach provides a co-learning environment that captures the collective (corporate) knowledge of the factors influencing planning, implementing, monitoring and reviewing outcomes, thus allowing critical success factors (CSFs) influencing the success of adaptive management to be identified. BBN provided the scaffolding for piecing together this knowledge, allowing managers to structure complex problems and conduct dynamic sensitivity and scenario analysis to identify where intervention or investment can significantly improve the practice of adaptive management within a natural resource management (NRM) agency.

Our analysis shows that short-term governance networks operate on trust. Seemingly, differences in goals can be put aside for a collective good; that is, being able to cooperate and find solutions to conservation issues. Additionally, exchange and flow of information are a necessity in network functions. However, a network may be successful despite difficulties in flow of information, as our case of Siberian Jay Network shows. Using both qualitative and quantitative evidence, our analysis serves as a test for the usefulness of social network analysis method in bringing depth to understanding of both formal and informal governance networks. 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

abstract="To learn more rapidly and increase flexibility in a world of growing complexity and change, firms are experimenting with new modes of organization, new reward systems, and less authoritarian values - for example, reducing hierarchy, increasing local decision-making responsibility and individual incentives, and rewarding innovation. But local decision making and individual autonomy lead to management anarchy unless managers account for the interconnections and long-term side-effects of their local decisions. Laudable goals such as `empowering' and `enabling' individuals often prove counterproductive unless managers can act locally and think globally. Managers must become `systems thinkers' as well as better learners. This paper reports on one approach to these issues: forming collaborative action research partnerships with corporations to 1) develop new tools to accelerate learning, and 2) test those tools in real organizations where managers face pressing issues. We argue that simulation is an important element of successful learning laboratories to develop systems thinking and promote organizational learning. A case study focused on improving quality and total cost performance in the insurance industry is presented to illustrate how these tools can both produce insight and focus change.",

Based on interviews, expert modelling and group modelling, this inductive case study develops a causal loop diagram that displays eight interacting feedback loops to explain resistance to change and the role that participatory strategies play in addressing this. The model contributes to the theoretical debate on how resistance affects change by providing propositions that integrate the traditional and modern paradigms.

abstract="Coastal floodplains are complex regions that form the interface between human, physical and natural systems. This paper describes the development, application and evaluation of a conceptual foundation for quantitative integrated floodplain risk assessments using the recently-developed SPR systems model. The SPR systems model is a conceptual model that combines the well-established Source-Pathway-Receptor (SPR) approach with the concept of system diagrams. In comparison to the conventional approach, the systems model provides spatially explicit quasi-2D descriptions of the floodplain in terms of constituent elements and possible element linkages. The quasi-2D SPR, as it will henceforth be referred to in this paper, is not the final product of this work, but is an important intermediate stage which has been pursued as part of a wider European flood risk project THESEUS (www.theseusproject.eu). Further research is currently on-going to provide full quantification of the quasi-2D SPR, and to add further refinements such that hydraulic assessments could follow on easily and rapidly from the results of these appraisals.The first part of the paper synthesises current conceptual treatment of coastal floodplains and identifies areas for improvement in describing coastal floodplains as complex systems. The synthesis demonstrates that the conceptual foundation of a 'typical' flood risk study often achieves a less comprehensive and integrated description of the floodplain than the quantitative models which it informs. From this synthesis, the quasi-2D SPR is identified as a more robust and informative conceptual foundation for an integrated risk assessment. The quasi-2D SPR has been applied to seven European coastal floodplains as part of the THESEUS project. The second part of the paper discusses in detail the application of the quasi-2D SPR to three contrasting floodplain systems - an estuary, a coastal peninsula and a mixed open coast/estuary site. The quasi-2D SPR provides a consistent approach for achieving comprehensive floodplain descriptions that are individual to each coastal floodplain. These are obtained through a robust, participatory model-building exercise, that facilitates developing a shared understanding of the system. The constructed model is a powerful tool for structuring and integrating existing knowledge across multiple disciplines. Applications of the quasi-2D SPR provide key insights into the characteristics of complex coastal floodplains - insights that will inform the quantification process. Finally, the paper briefly describes the on-going quantitative extension to the quasi-2D SPR. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

abstract="As part of its Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) Programme, the local government of Sumbawa District in West Nusa Tenggara Province of Eastern Indonesia initiated a partnership programme between the Forestry District Agency and tree grower cooperatives in 2002. The partnership scheme aims to reduce illegal logging and forest encroachment on abandoned state plantations initially developed in 1986. However, the cooperatives have no secure full rights to harvest the mature teak trees (Tectona grandis) inside the plantations, as important incentives to maintain their commitment. This paper aims to explore the potential benefits of different scenarios, as the basis for convincing the Ministry of Forestry (MoF) to give full secure rights to the local communities. In this study, we used a participatory modelling approach, to identify problems and to define future scenarios of partnership arrangements with the local key stakeholders. This research used the concept of system dynamics modelling, which included the two concepts of systems thinking and resilience. As a management tool, the visualisation of the management alternatives and their associated impacts had stimulated the community's awareness of the importance of protecting the teak plantations from illegal logging and forest encroachment. The simulation results have also shown how granting local communities a full secure access to manage the state forest does not necessarily reduce the revenue for the government at all levels. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, the tool kit of complex systems science could enrich our understanding of how industrial ecosystems might evolve over time. In this article, I illustrate how an important tool of complex systems science - agent-based simulation - can help to identify those potential elements of an industrial ecosystem that could work together to achieve more eco-efficient outcomes. For example, I show how agent-based simulation can generate cost-efficient energy futures in which groups of firms behave more ecoefficiently by introducing strategically located clusters of renewable, low-emissions, distributed generation. I then explain how role-playing games and participatory modeling can build trust and reduce conflict about the sharing of common-pool resources such as water and energy among small clusters of evolving agents. Collective learning can encourage potential industrial partners to gradually cooperate by exchanging byproducts and/or sharing common infrastructure by dint of their close proximity. This kind of coevolutionary learning, aided by participatory modeling, could help to bring about industrial symbiosis. 2009 by Yale University.",

The participatory modeling approach employed in this study led to the identification of new solutions to an old water resource problem regarding phosphorus loads to streams and St. Albans Bay. The modeling process provided a perceived neutral atmosphere for discussing water pollution issues that have historically been divisive and provided participants with greater understanding of local environmental issues and reduced historic conflict among actors. This study highlights the importance of considering the dynamics of social and technical factors in the use of modeling in natural resource planning processes.

abstract="Saltwater intrusion into potential drinking water aquifers due to the injection of CO2into deep saline aquifers is one of the potential hazards associated with the geological storage of CO2. Thus, in a site selection process, models for predicting the fate of the displaced brine are required, for example, for a risk assessment or the optimization of pressure management concepts. From the very beginning, this research on brine migration aimed at involving expert and stakeholder knowledge and assessment in simulating the impacts of injecting CO2into deep saline aquifers by means of a participatory modeling process. The involvement exercise made use of two approaches. First, guideline-based interviews were carried out, aiming at eliciting expert and stakeholder knowledge and assessments of geological structures and mechanisms affecting CO2-induced brine migration. Second, a stakeholder workshop including the World Cafe format yielded evaluations and judgments of the numerical modeling approach, scenario selection, and preliminary simulation results. The participatory modeling approach gained several results covering brine migration in general, the geological model sketch, scenario development, and the review of the preliminary simulation results. These results were included in revised versions of both the geological model and the numerical model, helping to improve the analysis of regional-scale brine migration along vertical pathways due to CO2injection.

abstract="A critical challenge for science in times of increasingly depleted natural resources is how policy and management can be improved to attain a pathway to sustainability. This paper argues that facilitating a learning experience for decision makers by employing participatory modelling and explicitly considering multiple tiers of governance can effectively contribute to achieve sustainable outcomes. Decision makers operate on different scales and respond to decisions made on other scales. However, shared beliefs can vary and policy interventions from different levels can be incompatible due to a lack of cross-sectoral and cross-scale coordination. Sustainability is determined by conditions defined by this process of interactive decision-making, and across various tiers of governance. To improve understanding at one scale in isolation with constant assumptions of the responses at other scales is likely to lead to unsustainable unintended side effects. Based on applied research in Indonesia, consequences for research design, methodological aspects of modelling and the process of decision support are discussed. The agent-based analysis links household livelihoods, deforestation, and fuel price changes. Focused on process-related aspects, this work identifies the effectiveness of participatory modelling to challenge shared beliefs and, therefore, facilitate a potentially valuable learning experience for decision makers. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper presents an overview of soft system dynamics methods under a participatory modeling framework that is consistent with participatory approaches to assessing sustainable forest management. Three general types of soft system dynamics models are described: cognitive mapping, qualitative system dynamics, and fuzzy cognitive mapping. The three models entail different information requirements, knowledge base, and varying degrees of complexity. The models can be developed and used as stand-alone resource management tools. Or, depending on the level of complexity and the availability of information about the resource management system in question, they can be integrated to constitute a more robust and flexible planning framework. This paper describes applications of these models in different case studies. Applications of the first two models are reported in detail elsewhere, hence, they are only described briefly. The third model, called fuzzy cognitive mapping, is described in more detail including an illustrative case study.

Adaptation of farm management practices in response to seasonal climate forecasts may be one means of achieving these objectives. This paper describes the interactive and iterative process by which farmers, researchers, extension agents, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders collaborated to create, calibrate, and validate the Dynamic North Florida Dairy Farm model (DyNoFlo), a whole-farm decision support system to decrease nitrogen leaching while maintaining profitability under variable climate conditions. Participatory modeling may enhance the creation of adoptable and adaptable user-friendly models that include environmental, economic and biophysical components. By providing farmers, policy makers, and other stakeholders with a more holistic view of current practices, common ground among them was more easily identified and collaboration was fostered. Farmer values included willingness to be good environmental stewards when they are profitable. The participatory research and development process enhanced understanding of and potential adaptation to seasonal climate variability conditioned to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases in light of increasing environmental regulations and economic challenges. Adoption of the collaboratively-developed DyNoFlo is expected to be higher than usual because stakeholders feel greater ownership of the final product. 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

abstract="Introduction of a participatory element into an existing policymaking scheme challenges the whole policy-making practice, since unmanageable stakes tend to mask proper distribution of interests and hide wider needs of the society. The objective of this research is to describe participatory modelling procedures and, by means of system dynamics, to construct a participatory model that allows an input of policy stakeholders into policy-making and policy administration streams via a rational balance of interest expression. The primary intention is to use these modelling techniques for the description of participatory procedures and apply them to the governance of wider public policy issues. The model is primarily targeted at the introduction of such mechanisms into the policy-making process that enable control of completeness of stake representation and at the balance of stake representation. Equally the model has to preclude policy makers from narrow interest advocacy against the public interest. Copyright 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

abstract="This paper is a reflexive analysis of a three-year participatory water research project conducted in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana, whose explicit objective was to initiate a multi-level dialogue to support the national Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy framework. The transdisciplinary team adopted the Companion Modeling approach (ComMod), using role-playing games and a computerized agent-based model to support the identification of a problemshed centered on issues of river bank cultivation, erosion, and flooding, and initiate a multi-level dialogue on ways that this problemshed could be tackled. On the basis of this experience, we identify three key criteria for transdisciplinary research to support innovative water governance: (1) the iterative adaptation of tools and facilitation techniques based on feedback from participants; (2) a common understanding of the objectives pursued and the approach used among researchers, who need to explicit their posture, and crucially; (3) the co-identification of a problemshed that diverse stakeholders are interested in tackling. Finally, we argue that the context in which research is funded and conducted in the development sector constitutes a challenge for researchers to be ``participants like any other'' in the projects they coordinate, which constitutes a barrier to true transdisciplinarity. 2018 by the authors.",

abstract="Public infrastructure is an interdependent system of actors, organisations, assets, services, the society it serves, and the context of each and their whole. This complexity presents research challenges for those focused at the system level, not the least that there is limited research in whole-of-system working for public infrastructure administration and the public sector more generally. Although the available literature appears unified in calling for a probing, pluralist approach, there are few examples of how to approach complex systems in practice. This paper derives from a research programme on the strategic intent and management of infrastructure systems. That programme used the New Zealand land transport system as its focus; nonetheless, it should have wider application given the shared issues being faced within infrastructure practice and matters of sustainability, resilience and system fitness more generally. By melding methods, the action research methodology is aimed at assisting researchers of complex systems and/or problems in gaining more fulsome insights and evidence to support theory. Accordingly, the methodology contributes to the understanding of how to approach infrastructure systems from a research perspective. It offers a road map, a means of sense-making and socialising the issues found at the whole-of-system level and a systemic diagnostic tool. 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",

keywords="Uncertainty analysis Open systems Systems analysis",
abstract="Background: The research field of energy system analysis is faced with the challenge of increasingly complex systems and their sustainable transition. The challenges are not only on a technical level but also connected to societal aspects. Energy system modelling plays a decisive role in this field, and model properties define how useful it is in regard to the existing challenges. For energy system models, evaluation methods exist, but we argue that many decisions upon properties are rather made on the model generator or framework level. Thus, this paper presents a qualitative approach to evaluate frameworks in a transparent and structured way regarding their suitability to tackle energy system modelling challenges. Methods: Current main challenges and framework properties that potentially contribute to tackle these challenges are derived from a literature review. The resulting contribution matrix and the described application procedure is then applied exemplarily in a case study in which the properties of the Open Energy Modelling Framework are checked for suitability to each challenge. Results: We identified complexity (1), scientific standards (2), utilisation (3), interdisciplinary modelling (4), and uncertainty (5) as the main challenges. We suggest three major property categories of frameworks with regard to their capability to tackle the challenges: open-source philosophy (1), collaborative modelling (2), and structural properties (3). General findings of the detailed mapping of challenges and properties are that an open-source approach is a pre-condition for complying with scientific standards and that approaches to tackle the challenges complexity and uncertainty counteract each other. More research in the field of complexity reduction within energy system models is needed. Furthermore, while framework properties can support to address problems of result communication and interdisciplinary modelling, an important part can only be addressed by communication and organisational structures, thus, on a behavioural and social level. Conclusions: We conclude that the relevance of energy system analysis tools needs to be reviewed critically. Their suitability for tackling the identified challenges deserves to be emphasised. The approach presented here is one contribution to improve current evaluation methods by adding this aspect. 2018, The Author(s).",

abstract="The severe consequences of a Critical Infrastructure (CI) crisis demand continued research directed toward proactive and reactive management strategies. Despite the best efforts of governments and communities, the diversity of stakeholders, conflicting demands for resources, and a lack of trust among organizations create complexities that limit the effectiveness of the response. This paper identifies four specific problems that appear to reoccur when CIs are challenged: heterogeneity, multiple and inconsistent boundaries, resilience building and knowledge transfer and sharing. A combination of collaborative modeling and software simulation methodologies is proposed in order to identify the interrelationships among diverse stakeholders when managing the preparation for and reaction to a CI crisis. This approach allows experts to work together and share experiences through the modeling process which can lead them to a better understanding of how other organizations work and integrate different perspectives. In addition, simulation models enable domain experts to understand the consequences of certain policies in the short and long terms, thus improving the crisis managers' knowledge for future crisis situations. This paper presents a practical case of a hypothetical crisis in the CI sector and the approach used in order to deal with the four problems identified above. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

abstract="We developed a watershed sediment source and delivery model for use in evaluating conservation trade‐offs in southern Minnesota, where sediment loading has been identified as a priority and there is substantial public investment in cleaner water. The model was developed in a stakeholder process and links user‐specified management options to reductions in sediment loading at the outlet of a 2,880‐km2 intensively farmed watershed. The simulation model was formulated to allocate total sediment load among sources, which provides robustness to the model by constraining the relative magnitude of sediment loads and their reduction. A novel topographic filtering approach was used to develop spatially distributed maps of sediment delivery ratio, addressing the problem of storage between source and outlet. The dominant sediment source in the watershed is erosion of steep streamside bluffs in response to increases in river discharge. Rates of bluff erosion as a function of river discharge were determined from sediment loads measured at pairs of gages on individual streams. Using this analysis, upland water storage to reduce peak river flow was included as an option in the model. The model development process was designed to promote transparency and develop stakeholder trust through multiple meetings in which an underlying sediment budget was developed and refined. The model runs rapidly, providing real‐time response to user choice and supporting Monte Carlo simulation of the influence of uncertainty on the calculated sediment load. The stakeholder group used the model to identify a priority strategy for investing public funds to improve water quality.Alternate abstract:Plain Language SummaryWater pollution from excess sediment poses serious threats to the livelihood of aquatic ecosystem as well as recreation. We present a watershed model, developed through a collaboration with local stakeholders, that evaluates different conservation scenarios to reduce sediment source and delivery. The model is used to bring consensus among stakeholders in identifying a priority strategy for investing public funds to improve water quality.",

abstract="Sustainable management of coastal systems can only be achieved with an effective science-policy interface that integrates the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection, social progress and economic growth. The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure to guide such a process by embracing the challenge of assessing complex systems for scenario simulations to support potential policy decisions. Based on applications of the SAF in six Baltic Sea case studies within the BONUS BaltCoast project, the SAF was revisited and further developed. Two additional steps were introduced partly to enhance implementation and decision validation and partly to facilitate the reiterative process with the addition of monitoring and evaluation. The SAF now includes six steps (Issue Identification, System Design, System Formulation, System Assessment, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation). A list of actions for each step clearly defines what needs to be done before progressing to the next SAF step. Activities within each step were improved to better integrate governance - citizen collaboration and improve the science-policy interface. Three auxiliary tools, developed in the BONUS BaltCoast project to support particular actions, were integrated in the different steps to facilitate application of the SAF by practitioners and scientists alike. The added focus on the stakeholder participation resulted in further actions being listed in the new steps to maintain stakeholder engagement and counteract stakeholder fatigue. The revised SAF is presented and discussed together with lessons learned from the different applications in five Baltic Sea study sites.",

abstract="The physical interconnection of ground and surface waters is rarely acknowledged in inter-state and international agreements over surface water. This is especially true in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo basin, where groundwater pumping is at the heart of several disputes and legal cases related to compliance with intergovernmental water agreements. This research considers the Upper and Middle Rio Grande basin to explore how groundwater use and management interact with interstate (i.e. intranational within the US) and international relations (US-Mexico). We consider three distinct geographic regions to address the following questions: how have intergovernmental surface water agreements affected local groundwater management and policies? And, how does groundwater management at local scale influence intergovernmental relations over water? We combine documentary data and interview data collected through extensive fieldwork during 2016 and 2017. The analysis reveals the emergence of both state-driven and community-based groundwater initiatives aimed at reconciling needs and obligations stemming from different geographical and institutional levels. The analysis uncovers strong institutional interplay across water management levels and suggests that compliance with intergovernmental agreements in federal and international contexts both affects and is affected by local groundwater management. Moreover, we observed that while local water managers are sometimes prevented from solving problems locally due to interstate rules, opportunities for innovation in local groundwater governance can also be triggered by compliance obligations at other levels.",

Marine megafauna conservation is often further complicated by contemporaneous, and sometimes competing, social, economic, and ecological factors and related management objectives. Advances in emerging technologies and applications, such as remotely-sensed oceanographic data, animal-based telemetry, novel computational analyses, innovations in structured decision making, and stakeholder engagement and policy are supporting complex systems and complexity-aware approaches to megafauna conservation and research. Here we discuss several applications that focus on megafauna fisheries bycatch and exemplify how complex systems and complexity-aware approaches that inherently acknowledge and account for the complexity of ocean systems can advance megafauna conservation and research. Emerging technologies, applications and approaches that embrace, rather than ignore, complexity can drive innovation and success in megafauna conservation and research.",

abstract="This paper presents an integrated, computer-based generic framework to couple urban water related models into a decision support tool (DST) for urban-water management. The DST, built on a participatory modelling approach, enables stakeholders to analyze impacts of climate variation, population growth, and alternative management solutions ranging from centralized to distributed options. The coupling of external models, building of the DST, and execution of simulation processes is achieved by employing GoldSim, which is linked to a database management tool and a shared library. A post-processing package generates outcomes for decision makers in the form of a new criterion, the Water System Performance Index (WSPI). The application of DST is demonstrated for the water service area of the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities (SLCDPU). Results show that a decentralized alternative increases the reliability of the system without changing the system's vulnerability. Centralized alternative improves the overall performance of the system based on WSPI results, but decrease in performance is still noticeable under the hot and dry climate condition. Overall, the system is very sensitive to changes in climatic conditions. Results show that during droughts, supply management is not the sole solution and compulsory demand-management practices should be instigated.",

abstract="Individuals working within the water, sanitation and hygiene for development (WASH) sector grapple daily with complex technical, social, economic, and environmental issues that often produce unexpected outcomes that are difficult to plan for and resolve. Here we propose a method we are calling the `Participatory Systems-based Planning and Evaluation Process' (PS-PEP) that combines structural factor analysis and collaborative modeling to guide teams of practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders through a process of modeling and interpreting how factors systemically and dynamically influence sustained access to WASH services. The use and utility of the PS-PEP is demonstrated with a regional team of water committee members in the municipality of Jalapa, Nicaragua who participated in a two-day modeling workshop. Water committee members left the workshop with a clear set of action items for water service planning and management in Jalapa, informed by the analysis of systemic influences and dependencies between key service factors. In so doing, we find that the PS-PEP provides a powerful tool for WASH project or program planning, evaluation, management and policy, the continued use of which could offer unprecedented growth in understanding of WASH service complexity for a broad spectrum of service contexts.",

abstract="Sustainable groundwater management strategies in water-scarce countries need to guide future decision-making processes pragmatically, by simultaneously considering local needs, environmental problems and economic development. The socio-hydrogeological approach named 'Bir Al-Nas' has been tested in the Grombalia region (Cap Bon Peninsula, Tunisia), to evaluate the effectiveness of complementing hydrogeochemical and hydrogeological investigations with the social dimension of the issue at stake (which, in this case, is the identification of groundwater pollution sources). Within this approach, the social appraisal, performed through social network analysis and public engagement of water end-users, allowed hydrogeologists to get acquainted with the institutional dimension of local groundwater management, identifying issues, potential gaps (such as weak knowledge transfer among concerned stakeholders), and the key actors likely to support the implementation of the new science-based management practices resulting from the ongoing hydrogeological investigation. Results, hence, go beyond the specific relevance for the Grombaila basin, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the importance of including social assessment in any given hydrogeological research aimed at supporting local development through groundwater protection measures.",

abstract="Protected areas are often burdened with conflicts between environmental managers and neighboring rural communities. Unsuccessful top-down approaches for conservation may be replaced by alternative forms of systemic management involving local actors in the design and implementation of conservation management. Although theoretically sound and appealing, the involvement of local residents in the management of protected areas is often impaired in practice by scale mismatches, conflicting values and interests, power imbalance, and a lack of trust among actors. In this paper, we describe a process initiated in Zimbabwe to create a fair and balanced locally designed arena where local communities and protected area managers may collaborate to produce effective management plans. Adopting the Companion Modeling approach, we conducted a participatory modeling experiment to codesign a role-playing game that simulates the interactions between farming activities, livestock herding practices, and wildlife in a virtual landscape reproducing local social-ecological dynamics. After 18 months of intensive ethnographical fieldwork to gain knowledge and legitimacy, we spent one year codesigning the first version of the game with a group of volunteer villagers. The game, called Kulayijana (teaching each other), was tested and validated by other members of the rural communities and subsequently presented to protected area managers. We show how this approach allowed the negotiation of uncertainties and their inclusion in a model that constitutes a shared representation of farmers' interactions with the protected area. We emphasize the fact that working with marginalized actors first increased participation, appropriation, and confidence of rural communities to engage in a multistakeholder debate, thus reducing power imbalance among actors. We conclude by discussing the next phase of our work: the necessary involvement of conservation actors in the Kulayijana team, and the implementation of Kulayijana with higher hierarchical levels.",

abstract="Trade-offs are manifestations of the complex dynamics in interdependent social-ecological systems. Addressing trade-offs involves challenges of perception due to the dynamics of interdependence. We outline the challenges associated with addressing trade-offs and analyze knowledge coproduction as a practice that may contribute to tackling trade-offs in social-ecological systems. We discuss this through a case study in coastal Kenya in which an iterative knowledge coproduction process was facilitated to reveal social-ecological trade-offs in the face of ecological and socioeconomic change. Representatives of communities, government, and NGOs attended two integrative workshops in which methods derived from systems thinking, dialogue, participatory modeling, and scenarios were applied to encourage participants to engage and evaluate trade-offs. Based on process observation and interviews with participants and scientists, our analysis suggests that this process lead to increased appreciation of interdependences and the way in which trade-offs emerge from complex dynamics of interdependent factors. The process seemed to provoke a reflection of knowledge assumptions and narratives, and management goals for the social-ecological system. We also discuss how stakeholders link these insights to their practices.",

This paper contributes a model representing the network interactions of rainwater harvesting (RWH) infrastructure innovators and other organisations in the UK RWH niche to identify how resilience and sustainability feature within niche governance in practice. The RWH network interaction model was constructed using a modified participatory social network analysis (SNA). The SNA was further analysed through the application of a two-part analytical framework based on niche management and the safe, resilient and sustainable ('Safe and SuRe') framework. Weak interactions between some RWH infrastructure innovators and other organisations highlighted reliance on a limited number of persuaders to influence the regime and landscape, which were underrepresented. Features from niche creation and management were exhibited by the RWH network interaction model, though some observed characteristics were not represented. Additional Safe and SuRe features were identified covering diverse innovation, responsivity, no protection, unconverged expectations, primary influencers, polycentric or adaptive governance and multiple learning-types. These features enable RWH infrastructure innovators and other organisations to reflect on improving resilience and sustainability, though further research in other sectors would be useful to verify and validate observation of the seven features.",

abstract="There has been a growing recognition regarding the use of social networks to engage communities in government actions. However, despite increasing awareness of social networks, there is very limited evidence for their application in relation to climate policy. This study fills this gap by assessing the potential of social networks for engaging local communities in climate adaptation policy, drawing on a case study of the Shoalhaven region in Australia. Participants from key representative groups were recruited using a purposive snowball sampling technique (N = 24). By mapping knowledge acquisition and diffusion networks in relation to climate adaption at the local scale, this study identified key nodes within the networks. Findings demonstrate that although climate adaptation information was acquired from a diverse range of sources, the sharing knowledge networks were far more dispersed. Furthermore, although 165 knowledge sources were identified, three nodes had coverage cross the entire network, and as such acted as boundary spanners within the sharing network. This research demonstrates the utility of social network analysis to reveal the underlying knowledge networks and structures that influence community engagement pathways and in doing so outlines key implications in relation to engaging local communities in climate policy and action. Policy relevance The rapid development of adaptation as a mainstream strategy for managing the risks of climate change has resulted in the emergence of a broad range of adaptation policies and management strategies globally. However, the success of these initiatives is largely dependent on their acceptance and uptake by local communities, which to date remains a significant challenge. Accordingly, policy makers require novel approaches to overcome barriers to community engagement so as to enhance the likely success of community engagement pathways. This article demonstrates the value of using social network analysis to reveal the underlying knowledge network structures. This approach makes it possible to identify key individuals within a community who can disseminate adaptation information quickly across broad geographic ranges. By utilizing this approach, policy makers globally will be able to increase the extent to which adaption initiatives are accepted and adhered to by local communities, thus increasing their success.",

abstract="Citizen science is often envisaged as a means to promote community participation in marine resource management. However, its potential contribution in this field is limited by stakeholders' perceptions on the value and utility of data collected in this way. This is exacerbated in the Australian context by insufficient resources to inform management regarding the country's extensive coastline. The present study employs a systems thinking methodology to map stakeholders' conceptual models of citizen science in Western Australia. This shows that a fundamental policy shift must occur in order to encompass the views of all stakeholders and converge on a common understanding of its role and utility of citizen science beyond the current science-centric discourse.",

However, considerable uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their significance for societies with the current state of scientific knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change and identify societal adaptation options. The stakeholder-informed ecosystem modelling approach has succeeded in driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with scientists, broadening knowledge about climate change impacts in the social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and about societal uses and values.",

abstract="The move toward an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires new operational tools in order to support management decisions. Among them, ecosystem- and fisheries-based models are critical to quantitatively predict the consequences of future scenarios by integrating available knowledge about the ecosystem across different scales. Despite increasing development of these complex system models in the last decades, their operational use is still currently limited in Europe. Many guidelines are already available to help the development of complex system models for advice yet they are often ignored. We identified three main impediments to the use of complex system models for decision support: (1) their very complexity which is a source of uncertainty; (2) their lack of credibility, (3) and the challenge of communicating/transferring complex results to decision makers not accustomed to deal with multivariate uncertain results. In this paper, we illustrate these somehow theoretical ``best practices'' with tangible successful examples, which can help the transfer of complex system models from academic science to operational advice. We first focus on handling uncertainty by optimizing model complexity with regards to management objectives and technical issues. We then list up methods, such as transparent documentation and performance evaluation, to increase confidence in complex system models. Finally, we review how and where complex system models could fit within existing institutional and legal settings of the current European fisheries decision framework. We highlight where changes are required to allow for the operational use of complex system models. All methods and approaches proposed are illustrated with successful examples from fisheries science or other disciplines.

abstract="Understanding the importance of cross-sectoral implications of climate and socio-economic change in Scotland is essential for adaptation policy. This study explored the direct and indirect sectoral impacts of future change using the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform. There is great spatial diversity in projected impacts across Scotland, and increasing uncertainty in the direction of change of impacts from the national to regional scale associated with climate uncertainty. Further uncertainty associated with socio-economic change results in 6 out of 13 indicators (artificial surfaces, biodiversity vulnerability, forest area, land-use intensity, irrigation usage and land-use diversity) with robust directions of change at the national scale and only three (artificial surfaces, forest area and irrigation usage) that are robust across all regions of Scotland. Complex interactions between socio-economic scenario assumptions (e.g. food imports, population and GDP), climatic suitability and agricultural productivity and profitability lead to significant national and regional changes in the distribution and extent of land cover types, with resultant cross-sectoral interactions with water, forestry and biodiversity. Consequently, stakeholders characterised robust adaptation policy options, within the CLIMSAVE participatory process, as those beneficial to society (and the country) in all scenarios, irrespective of the direction of change of the impacts. The integration in CLIMSAVE of a participatory scenario development process and an integrated participatory modelling framework has allowed the exploration of future uncertainty in a structured approach and better represented the importance of qualitative information and the social and institutional contexts within adaptation research.",

abstract="The Dominican fishing community of Buen Hombre is struggling to reconcile its fishing activities with the state of the coral reef ecosystem on which it depends. The ecosystem is showing signs of deterioration, and this seems to be resulting in large part because of the fishing activities of the Buen Hombre fishermen. The institutional arrangements of the fishermen themselves, and of relevant external organizations, have not kept pace with important technological and demographic changes that have affected the community. This paper presents the results of an analysis that unpacks these processes via a statistical analysis of fishermen behavior and a social network analysis of the ``cofishing'' network that these fishermen constitute. The statistical analysis shows that gear choice is very important in explaining the amount of fish caught, both as a direct factor and as a mediator of other factors such as membership in the local fishermen's association. The social network analysis complements this result by demonstrating that gear choice also serves to segment the fishermen into separate groups, with few direct linkages between them. The resulting gear-based fragmentation of the community is seen to have negative implications for the ability of the fishermen to act collectively to conserve their fishery. The paper concludes with some thoughts and suggestions for how the community might move forward, including expanding the membership of the fishermen's association and strengthening ties between fishing groups as well as ties between the community and relevant governmental agencies.",

abstract="Governance processes to address environmental change involve many different actors from multiple spatial, temporal and socio-political scales, not all of whom are connected by hierarchy and whose actions cannot always be mandated. In the environmental governance literature, Social Network Analysis (SNA) has been found useful in understanding complex governance arrangements. In this paper we present and reflect on our experience with the Net-Map tool for participatory network mapping. The Net-Map tool was applied in three transdisciplinary case studies for three different purposes: (a) to contribute to an improved understanding of biodiversity knowledge flows in Europe, (b) to explore the interplay between actors with influence on water, agriculture, and energy developments at the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, and (c) to understand the challenges facing stakeholders engaged in conservation and economic development in a Southeast Asian mountain range. The case studies explore how network maps can serve as boundary objects to engage stakeholders of diverse points of view and jointly design strategies to address governance challenges. More specifically they show how network maps are used to gain a better understanding of governance situations, to help stakeholders identify strategies for navigation of the complex networks in which they are embedded and to support transdisciplinary research processes. We close with some reflections on the potential and limitations of the Net-Map tool in facilitating multi-stakeholder processes and disentangling complex governance arrangements.",

abstract="How social networks support or constrain the transition to co-management of small-scale fisheries and marine reserves is poorly understood. In this paper, we undertake a comparative analysis of the social network structures associated with the transition to co-management in three Jamaican marine reserves. Data from quantitative social relational surveys (n =380) are integrated with data from semi-structured interviews (n =63) and focus groups (n =10) to assess how patterns of relational ties and interactions between and among fishermen and other local level actors (e.g., managers, wardens, NGO staff) support and constrain the transition to co-management. Our research suggests that the transitions to co-management were supported by a combination of three network structure and relational attributes: (i) the presence and position of institutional entrepreneurs; (ii) a dense central core of network actors; and (iii) the prevalence of horizontal ties and vertical linkages held by the community-based organizations formally responsible for the management of the marine reserves. Our findings also show that overall low network cohesion in the three reserves and limited social influence among the wardens may be problematic for sustained collective action that extends beyond the core set of network actors. These findings suggest the importance of strategies to enhance collective action, specifically through attention to the attributes of the corresponding social networks, as a means to contribute to successful transitions to co-management of marine reserves and small-scale fisheries. Our results provide more precise guidance, through social network analysis, on where in the respective networks social capital and leadership may require support or enhancement, and thus on how to target interventions for greatest effect.",

abstract="There is a growing interest in the use of fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) as a participatory method for understanding social-ecological systems (SESs). In recent years, FCM has been used in a diverse set of contexts ranging from fisheries management to agricultural development, in an effort to generate transparent graphical models of complex systems that are useful for decision making, illuminate the core presumptions of environmental stakeholders, and structure environmental problems for scenario development. This increase in popularity is because of FCM's bottom-up approach and its ability to incorporate a range of individual, community-level, and expert knowledge into an accessible and standardized format. Although there has been an increase in the use of FCM as an environmental planning and learning tool, limited progress has been made with regard to the method's relationship to existing resilience frameworks and how the use of FCM compares with other participatory modeling/approaches available. Using case study data developed from community-driven models of the bushmeat trade in Tanzania, we examine the usefulness of FCM for promoting resilience analysis among stakeholders in terms of identifying key state variables that comprise an SES, evaluating alternative SES equilibrium states, and defining desirable or undesirable state outcomes through scenario analysis.",

abstract="The prevalence of barriers to the implementation of alternative and more integrated approaches to urban water management has been observed by many researchers and managers. This study analyses the interconnected nature of these barriers using a combination of interpretive structural modelling and systems thinking methods. Based on empirical data from an urban case study catchment this study shows that barriers not only reinforce each other, but also create persistent self-reinforcing effects within a barrier interaction network. Evidence of feedback structures was primarily found in the institutional and logistical management areas. These systemic feedback structures create resistance to the implementation of alternative urban water management strategies resulting in the status quo. Knowledge of barrier interactions provides a rational basis for targeted and prioritized management interventions.",

abstract="Learning is gaining attention in relation to governance processes for contemporary environmental challenges; however, scholarship at the nexus of learning and environmental governance lacks clarity and understanding about how to define and measure learning, and the linkages between learning, social interactions, and environment. In response, this study aimed to advance and operationalize a typology of learning in an environmental governance context, and examined if a participatory decision-making process (adaptive co-management) for climate change adaptation fostered learning. Three types of learning were identified: cognitive learning, related to the acquisition of new or the structuring of existing knowledge; normative learning, which concerns a shift in viewpoints, values or paradigms, and relational learning, referring to an improved understanding of others' mindsets, enhanced trust and ability to cooperate. A robust mixed methods approach with a focus on quantitative measures including concept map analysis, social network analysis, and self-reflective questions, was designed to gauge indicators for each learning type. A participatory decision-making process for climate change adaptation was initiated with stakeholders in the Niagara region, Canada. A pseudo-control group was used to minimize external contextual influences on results. Clear empirical evidence of cognitive and relational learning was gained; however, the results from normative learning measures were inconclusive. The learning typology and measurement method operationalized in this research advances previous treatments of learning in relation to participatory decision-making processes, and supports adaptive co-management as a governance strategy that fosters learning and adaptive capacity.",

The Tisa valley is regularly and increasingly faced with hazardous floods at very limited local budgets and high poverty rates. In order to make flood risk management more resilient and better adapted to climate change, scientists and stakeholders applied a set of qualitative and quantitative modelling approaches to characterise prevailing flood risk management, to discover respective vulnerabilities and to identify barriers and options of adaptive capacity. The former were found in the defensive mentality paradigm and the inert and hierarchical structure of present institutions, the latter in, firstly, an enormous potential to link the knowledge of different stakeholders in the region, secondly, a better integration of the individual flood preparedness of households and thirdly, the active involvement of the Church as institution in local flood risk management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

abstract="This paper presents an approach to enhance the role of local stakeholders in dealing with urban floods. The concept is based on the DIANE-CM project (Decentralised Integrated Analysis and Enhancement of Awareness through Collaborative Modelling and Management of Flood Risk) of the 2nd ERANET CRUE funding initiative. The main objective of the project was to develop and test an advanced methodology for enhancing the resilience of local communities to flooding. Through collaborative modelling, a social learning process was initiated that enhances the social capacity of the stakeholders due to the interaction process. The other aim of the project was to better understand how data from hazard and vulnerability analyses and improved maps, as well as from the near real-time flood prediction, can be used to initiate a public dialogue (i.e. collaborative mapping and planning activities) in order to carry out more informed and shared decision-making processes and to enhance flood risk awareness. The concept of collaborative modelling was applied in two case studies: (1) the Cranbrook catchment in the UK, with focus on pluvial flooding; and (2) the Alster catchment in Germany, with focus on fluvial flooding. As a result of the interactive and social learning process, supported by sociotechnical instruments, an understanding of flood risk was developed amongst the stakeholders and alternatives for flood risk management for the respective case study area were jointly developed and ranked as a basis for further planning and management.",

Regional authorities are initiating a wastewater reclamation project conveying treated municipal wastewater to water users, including potentially the Lockyer Valley.

A participatory modelling approach was used to analyse the consequences of changed water availability at the farm scale. This approach incorporates both farmer and scientist knowledge and gives due attention to non-technical issues like perception and acceptance. Two cropping patterns were worked out to forecast the effects on water deficit and crop yield in the projected situation.",

abstract="The study described in this paper investigates the relative merits of two peer-reviewed earthquake-induced landslide models using participatory model assessment. The earthquake-induced landslide hazard models assessed are a simplified Newmark's displacement model and a recently developed knowledge-based model. Participatory model assessment involves conducting facilitated participatory processes where the model(s) are used for aiding decisions within a socio-behavioral experiment designed for collecting data to evaluate formal hypotheses about the model(s). The paper sets out the design of the participatory model assessment--a series of workshops involving experts and potential model end-users that incorporated a roleplay site selection task. Quantitative data elicited using a set of entrance and exit questionnaires were analyzed to investigate hypotheses about the models. Participants found the knowledge-based model to be significantly more complete and more informative for their roleplay task. Overall, the two models did not yield significant differences with respect to issues such as task efficiency or task outcome satisfaction. Lastly, it was found that education level and disciplinary perspectives (of those analyzed) did not significantly affect outcomes, suggesting that a wide demographic of participants can be used for participatory model assessments. Additional research is needed to assess the models in different contexts, as well as more broadly developing a set of best practices for conducting participatory model assessments of other natural hazard and risk models intended to support decision-making.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

abstract="Stakeholder participation is becoming increasingly important in water resources management. In participatory processes, stakeholders contribute by putting forward their own perspective, and they benefit by enhancing their understanding of the factors involved in decision making. A diversity of modeling tools can be used to facilitate participatory processes. Bayesian networks are well suited to this task for a variety of reasons, including their ability to structure discussions and visual appeal. This research focuses on developing and testing a set of evaluation criteria for public participation. The advantages and limitations of these criteria are discussed in the light of a specific participatory modeling initiative. Modeling work was conducted in the Upper Guadiana Basin in central Spain, where uncontrolled groundwater extraction is responsible for wetland degradation and conflicts between farmers, water authorities, and environmentalists. Finding adequate solutions to the problem is urgent because the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive requires all aquatic ecosystems to be in a ``good ecological state'' within a relatively short time frame. Stakeholder evaluation highlights the potential of Bayesian networks to support public participation processes.",

abstract="Integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) have had limited success in addressing the often conflicting objectives of conservation and development. We developed a model with local participants to explore the trade-offs between conservation and development in southeastern Cameroon, where illegal hunting is regarded as the greatest challenge to conservation. We simulated the effects of different ICDP strategies by varying the degree of focus on antipoaching activities, anticorruption measures and direct development investments, and by varying the overall budget for such activities. Our outcome variables were numbers of selected wildlife species and household incomes. The model outcomes from the different scenarios were used to stimulate debate among stakeholders. Contributing to poverty alleviation while maintaining current animal population sizes will be extremely difficult and will require long-term external financial support. Devoting greater attention to improving local environmental governance emerged as the highest priority for this investment. We used the model outputs to inform some of the major policy makers in the region. Participatory modeling is a valuable means of capturing the complexities of achieving conservation at landscape scales and of stimulating innovative solutions to entrenched problems.

abstract="This paper details the design and implementation of a participatory modelling process in the Baixo Guadiana River Basin, in Portugal. A group of stakeholders was involved in a causal mapping exercise that lead to the development of a shared view of the problems, pressures and impacts characterizing the river basin. A simulation model was also developed to support experimentation with alternative management scenarios for the area. The paper looks critically at the evaluation of the participatory modelling outcomes, both at the individual and group levels, discussing the role of this approach in supporting the scoping stages of river basin planning and management processes. On the downside, the unstable group composition seems to have hindered the chances of producing a higher impact in the functioning of the group, and subsequently the capacity to sustain the level of collaboration required to achieve the strategic river basin objectives established during the participatory modelling process. The paper discusses the issue of group stability as well as some options to overcome the limitations of unstable participant groups. The strengths of participatory modelling, as underlined by the Baixo Guadiana experience, include the flexibility to adapt the method to different contexts and participatory designs and the capacity to structure the active involvement of stakeholders, providing an open and shared language for collaborative policy design, fostering learning and knowledge integration.",

Large population declines in the last several decades have made it a candidate for possible listing under the Endangered Species Act. Listing was recently avoided in part because local working groups are developing long-range management plans in conjunction with federal and local agencies. The Foster Creek Conservation District, a working group in Douglas County, Washington, saw the potential for system dynamics to synthesize known sage-grouse dynamics and local land use patterns to support development of their Habitat Conservation Plan and subsequent land management decisions. This case study highlights the integration of science, local knowledge and social concerns into a participatory process that uses system dynamics as a forum for the exploration of the impacts of land management decisions upon the sage-grouse population and the landowners of Douglas County, Washington.",

Whereas other ComMod approaches have used role playing games as an interface between researchers and stakeholders - assuming that stakeholders have difficulties understanding a computer model - this paper explores the potential of a participatory modeling approach in which stakeholders are directly confronted with the model by assessing its assumptions, interpreting simulation results, and suggesting scenarios. The approach is applied to two villages in a watershed in northern Thailand. One lowland village, populated by farmers of mostly Thai ethnic origin, depends partially on an upland village inhabited by farmers of Hmong ethnic origin for its water supply. Water scarcity has led to conflicts between these two villages in the past. In three rounds of participatory simulation sessions the potential of the ComMod model was tested. Our findings confirm that researchers face particular challenges in making local stakeholders understand the model as a reproduction of reality and not as reality itself. The idea of a scenario as a hypothetical situation was also difficult to convey. An ex-post analysis among participants showed that farmers who attended several sessions had a clear understanding of the model and one- third of the participants thought it useful to exchange points of view with the other community and to define new collective rules for water sharing. Applying ComMod in a context that is characterized by social tensions and power differentials, however, needs careful consideration of the potential implications on less powerful actors.",

abstract="Participatory and integrated research approaches employed by a long-term Thai-Vietnamese-German collaborative research program, 'The Uplands Program', that address the vicious circles of resource scarcity, environmental degradation and rural poverty in mountainous regions of northern Thailand and northern Vietnam are discussed in this paper. We present two examples from the Thai component of the research program to show how different disciplines and stakeholders need to cooperate at different scales to make meaningful scientific contributions towards sustainable land use and rural development in mountainous regions. The case of resource conservation in the Thai highlands shows that local and scientific knowledge, conventional surveys and participatory modeling can be creatively combined. Integrated research on the potential of integrating fruit trees and associated technologies into mountain farming systems suggests that natural scientists have to work alongside economists and social scientists to avoid harmful effects of purely technology-driven and productivity-enhancing approaches. The success of new technologies cannot be measured solely by adoption rates and yield increases, but also needs to take into account their long-term impact on various groups of farmers and the ecological, economic and social trade-offs that they entail. Technical and institutional innovations need to go hand in hand to provide viable livelihood opportunities for smallholder farmers in mountain watersheds. The major lesson learned from the first six years of our research in the mountains of Thailand and Vietnam is that conventional and participatory approaches are not antagonistic; if scientists from various disciplines and research paradigms are open-minded, the combination of both approaches can produce meaningful results that cater for the needs of both the academic community and local stakeholders in mountain environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

abstract="Climate variability and change affects individuals and societies. Within agricultural systems, seasonal climate forecasting can increase preparedness and lead to better social, economic and environmental outcomes. However, climate forecasting is not the panacea to all our problems in agriculture. Instead, it is one of many risk management tools that sometimes play an important role in decision-making. Understanding when, where and how to use this tool is a complex and multi-dimensional problem. To do this effectively, we suggest a participatory, cross-disciplinary research approach that brings together institutions (partnerships), disciplines (e.g., climate science, agricultural systems science, rural sociology and many other disciplines) and people (scientist, policy makers and direct beneficiaries) as equal partners to reap the benefits from climate knowledge. Climate science can provide insights into climatic processes, agricultural systems science can translate these insights into management options and rural sociology can help determine the options that are most feasible or desirable from a socio-economic perspective. Any scientific breakthroughs in climate forecasting capabilities are much more likely to have an immediate and positive impact if they are conducted and delivered within such a framework. While knowledge and understanding of the socio-economic circumstances is important and must be taken into account, the general approach of integrated systems science is generic and applicable in developed as well as in developing countries. Examples of decisions aided by simulation output ranges from tactical crop management options, commodity marketing to policy decisions about future land use. We also highlight the need to better understand temporal- and spatial-scale variability and argue that only a probabilistic approach to outcome dissemination should be considered. We demonstrated how knowledge of climatic variability (CV), can lead to better decisions in agriculture, regardless of geographical location and socio-economic conditions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

abstract="The watersheds in which we live are comprised of a complex set of physical and social systems that interact over a range of spatial and temporal scales. These systems are continually evolving in response to changing climatic patterns, land use practices and the increasing intervention of humans. Management of these watersheds benefits from the development and application of models that offer a comprehensive and integrated view of these complex systems and the demands placed upon them. The utility of these models is greatly enhanced if they are developed in a participatory process that incorporates the views and knowledge of relevant stakeholders. System dynamics provides a unique mathematical framework for integrating the physical and social processes important to watershed management, and for providing an interactive interface for engaging the public. We have employed system dynamics modeling to assist in community-based water planning for a three-county region in north-central New Mexico. The planning region is centered on a {\~}165-km reach of the Rio Grande that includes the greater Albuquerque metropolitan area. The challenge, which is common to other arid/semi-arid environments, is to balance a highly variable water supply among the demands posed by urban development, irrigated agriculture, river/reservoir evaporation and riparian/in-stream uses. A description of the model and the planning process are given along with results and perspectives drawn from both.",

abstract="Increased intensity of agriculture and landscape homogenization are threatening biodiversity in landscapes. We reviewed 67 case studies addressing the impact of agriculture on biodiversity in model based scenario approaches and compared the information they provide on biodiversity, spatial characteristics, scenarios, and landscapes. We found an overall large diversity of approaches that we summarized statistically into six groups. -Biodiversity based agent based models-, -Expert based exploration of land use change with GIS- and -Land use approaches of biodiversity with spatially explicit statistical model- are specialized biodiversity studies with high complexity in terms of biodiversity modelling with agent-based models or mechanistic models. On the other hand, -Bioeconomic modelling of policy impacts in favor of restoration of beneficial habitats-, -Participatory simulation studies of landscape futures- and -Large scale multi criteria studies of innovative scenarios with optimization- do not consider species' behavior or landscape configuration, but do address a large range of socioeconomic and environmental issues. As a contribution to developing quantitative and policy-relevant biodiversity conservation studies in landscape, we present the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. We then suggest combining different approaches, particularly with the use of agent-based models and mechanistic models, integrating spatially explicit drivers of biodiversity change and the socio-economic context of farming in a participatory manner. We give recommendations on the inclusion of more taxa in future studies and collaboration between scientists from different disciplines to develop innovative solutions that can halt the biodiversity decline in agricultural landscapes."

abstract="Achieving inclusive value chain development is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of interconnected value chains and their social, economic, and ecological dimensions. While many policies and intervention options exist to upgrade value chains, there are fewer methods that can be used to understand and quantify the multidimensional impacts that value chain policies and interventions may have throughout the value chain. This paper addresses this methodological gap by employing a system dynamics (SD) modeling approach. SD models allow us to model and quantify the processes and relationships inherent in the value chain through simulations, serving as a policy laboratory for the empirical assessment of intervention options. An SD model of the MatiguaIs dairy value chain in Nicaragua was developed and tested through a participatory modeling process. Our research tested and evaluated the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of specific interventions and policies in the MatiguaIs dairy value chain with the goal of strengthening the competitiveness and inclusion of small- and medium-scale producers. These interventions centered on improving the feeding system, which was identified by stakeholders as the critical constraint to competitiveness. The policy analysis reveals that both improved pastures and increased use of concentrates raise producer milk productivity by 5{\%} and 11{\%}, respectively in the long run, but are also expensive strategies for smallholder producers, leading to a reduction in profits relative to the baseline by 1{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively. Consequently, policymakers should identify strategies that help to reduce concentrate costs and support producers with investments in improved pasture, while also promoting training in pasture management skills. Indeed, in the long-run, model results reveal that investment and training in pasture management results in a 30{\%} and 35{\%} increase in milk production during the wet and dry season, respectively. Simulation results further highlighted that intensifying the feeding system to improve cow milk yields is mainly profitable in the long term, and thus requires a longer-term perspective by policymakers. The model provides a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the MatiguaIs dairy value chain and the interactions between markets, coordination aspects, biophysical phenomena, and income. The system dynamics approach to value chain analysis further addresses a major analytical shortcoming in value chain analysis and provides decision makers with an improved platform for planning and policy formulation."

abstract="Rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa remains a huge challenge despite the successive agricultural development policies, most of which have failed to involve stakeholders actively. The present rise of pork demand in Benin calls for an assessment of the swine value chain (VC) to envision its development. A participatory approach is here proposed to join this assessment to a stimulation of innovation among stakeholders. The approach is divided in four stages: i) identification of actors and direct links along the VC, ii) characterisation of innovation practices, iii) identification of bottlenecks and opportunities using innovation system framework, and iv) measurement of agreement among VC actors about constraints and value-added sharing, using proportional piling tool. A second survey, two full years after the first one, assessed the impact of actions conducted with VC actors. A typological analysis of innovation practices was conducted to define -innovation profiles- among each of the three main categories of actors: swine stockbreeders (n-=-134), pork butchers (n-=-45) and input suppliers (n-=-25). Three innovation profiles were retained for each category, which may be understood as covering 2 distinct innovator profiles and one non-innovator profile. The profiles qualified as -innovators- accounted for 82{\%}, 84{\%}, and 76{\%}, respectively in stockbreeders, pork butchers and input suppliers. The lack of professionalisation appeared to actors as the main constraint. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) indicated that actors agreed to state that pork butchers gained the most part of the value-added, followed by input suppliers. The second survey showed favorable impacts of the approach and follow-up activities on exchanges and organisation within the VC. It is here advocated that the present participatory method, while characterising the value-chain in a rapid way, further sets the basis for the dialogue between actors and the stimulation of innovation along the VC, which can be further sustained through an exchange platform."

abstract="Urban agriculture has become an important research theme in recent years. Over the past decade, a number of different, diverse value chains have been established in the urban areas of developed and developing countries alike, with increasing convergence in their motivations related to food security and livelihoods development, particularly for poor and disadvantaged segments of society. However, for urban agriculture to be sustainable as a livelihoods and resilience strategy will require decision-support tools that allow planners and participants alike to jointly develop strategies and assess potential leverage points within urban food value chains. In this paper, we argue that system dynamics (SD) models combined with participatory approaches have important roles in bridging this gap, though these will need to be adapted to the spatial influences that exist in urban settings. We first review elements of urban agriculture and some of the policy challenges faced in this growing phenomenon. We follow this by motivating the role of SD models in the context of urban agriculture and note their potential utility in overlaying quantitative models of urban food value chains alongside their land-use characteristics, highlighting the dynamic feedbacks between intensive processes within changing urban food systems and extensive processes associated with land-use and planning. From this background, we introduce the concept of spatial group model building (SGMB), which adapts standard group model building concepts to account for both the spatial context of urban agriculture and enables a spatially sensitive, participatory approach to qualitative and quantitative model building. We provide a qualitative proof-of-concept of SGMB principles and techniques in the context of describing the setting and dynamic issues facing organic urban agriculture value chains in Christchurch, New Zealand. Our approach fills an important space between participatory GIS practices and the development of complex spatial system dynamics models, infusing systems thinking principles to participatory processes, while showing a way to enhance the future development of quantitative spatial system dynamics models more generally."

abstract="Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is one of the main diseases in potato production. The Netherlands has a high potato density and favourable weather conditions for the disease, and this combination leads to frequent outbreaks of late blight. A spatially explicit agent-based model of the host-pathogen system was used in workshops with conventional and organic farmers to demonstrate and discuss the potential role of resistant varieties for effective and sustainable control of late blight. We presented model-based scenarios and used qualitative and quantitative measures to analyse the effect of the workshop on farmers' perception on late blight control. The scenarios simulated effects of farmer decisions regarding the use of crop resistance and fungicide application on disease control at the landscape level over a period of ten years. The model showed that growing a resistant variety (with a single resistance gene) can reduce disease incidence in the landscape, however, after a couple of years resistance breakdown occurs by emergence of a new virulent P. infestans strain. If no countermeasures were taken the new virulent population could spread fast through the landscape, reducing potato yield of resistant fields. The model showed a number of resistance management strategies that could be effective to increase resistance durability. Differences in farmer perception were observed before and after the workshop as well as between conventional and organic farmers. By analysing the disease dynamics at the landscape level, the model showed the importance of collective action. To prevent emergence and spread of a virulent strain it is important to keep disease pressure low. To achieve this, all farmers have to cooperate. During the workshops farmers exchanged views and negotiated possible solutions. We conclude that the use of model-based scenarios in workshops was very useful to increase farmers' knowledge of the system and served as a good starting point for discussions among actors facing the complex problems of late blight control and potato resistance management.",

abstract="Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are criticized, amongst other reasons, for their basis in ideas suited to the neoliberal political economy and for the unequal distribution of power inherent in such models. However, PES can be a natural resource management approach that combines social and environmental objectives so that they not only serve to protect ecosystems such as tropical forests and wetlands but also to improve social conditions and rural development. Particularly for community-based PES, tools are needed to bring transparency to PES institutional settings and actor constellations by revealing power relations, as well as to empower local actors to engage in social learning through participatory processes. Considering both of these aspects will improve the equity aspects of PES and establish a social context conducive to a payment scheme that considers local behaviors and attitudes towards conservation. Close collaboration - in knowledge co-production processes - between social science and practitioners can address these challenges and support the PES design and implementation process.In this paper, we demonstrate how Net-Map, as a specific tool for Social Network Analysis (SNA), can make actor relations visible for the purpose of group discussion within participation processes. We present how the results of participatory Net-Map Interviews can be used for participatory PES development, implementation and evaluation. In particular, we explain and discuss this for three case studies in Costa Rica.We conclude that this combination - using empirical data from social sciences for participatory planning - facilitates the creation of a common understanding of the PES-governance models, the creation of ownership, and the consolidation of transparency and trust amongst the participants, as well as reflection on the existing social capital necessary for implementation. The results of the Net-Map tool support the design of inclusive and adaptive processes that shape institutions, choices, design and the implementation of policy instruments such as PES. The additional value of the tool is that it makes these processes transparent by generating knowledge during a participatory process and helps to balance the actors- interests and values. This method of undertaking research in combination with workshops has its limitations, as it reveals - to a group - confidential information given in personal interviews. Further, for the scenario development of PES design, actors must have a certain level of openness and creativity so that the PES design does not merely end up being a copy of the initially net-mapped PES example."

The co-development and use of empirical models for understanding the complexity of the physical system is combined with the use of role-playing games to ensure the active involvement of stakeholders. The approach is implemented in a top-down water quality planning process in Turkey. Results show its suitability for managing water quality in complex river basins in an inclusive manner and its substantial benefits in developing stakeholders- capacities and creating a cooperative environment."

Furthermore, partnerships that are advantageous for a collective may not necessarily be advantageous for an individual. This study investigated collaboration within the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) conservation sector - a system with reported inefficiencies and for which there has been a renewed call for collaborative partnerships. Collaborative partnerships were conceptualised as a social network and analysed using exponential random graph modelling. The prevalence of structural attributes associated with social processes considered to be important for solving collective action problems such as trust and innovation were investigated. Qualitative surveying techniques were used to measure the perceptions of collaboration held by individual actors within the network and the impact of organizational attributes on network formation and perceptions was assessed. Collaboration was found to be occurring within the conservation network and was positively perceived at the individual organisational level. At the collective level, the current collaborative network contains some structural characteristics important for addressing the collective-action problem of orangutan conservation, particularly through innovation and knowledge sharing. However efforts to develop trust between organisations may be needed. To improve returns on investment, future collaborative partnerships must be strategically implemented with individual roles and desired overall outcomes explicitly articulated. Increased operational transparency and improved performance evaluation will be critical for achieving improved collaborative efficiency."

abstract="Agricultural innovation systems (AIS) are increasingly recognized as complex adaptive systems in which interventions cannot be expected to create predictable, linear impacts. Nevertheless, the logic models and theory of change (ToC) used by standard-setting international agricultural research agencies and donors assume that agricultural research will create impact through a predictable linear adoption pathway which largely ignores the complexity dynamics of AIS, and which misses important alternate pathways through which agricultural research can improve system performance and generate sustainable development impact. Despite a growing body of literature calling for more dynamic, flexible and -complexity-aware- approaches to monitoring and evaluation, few concrete examples exist of ToC that takes complexity dynamics within AIS into account, or provide guidance on how such theories could be developed. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an example of how an empirically-grounded, complexity-aware ToC can be developed and what such a model might look like in the context of a particular type of program intervention. Two detailed case studies are presented from an agricultural research program which was explicitly seeking to work in a -complexity-aware- way within aquatic agricultural systems in Zambia and the Philippines. Through an analysis of the outcomes of these interventions, the pathways through which they began to produce impacts, and the causal factors at play, we derive a -complexity-aware- ToC to model how the cases worked. This middle-range model, as well as an overarching model that we derive from it, offer an alternate narrative of how development change can be produced in agricultural systems, one which aligns with insights from complexity science and which, we argue, more closely represents the ways in which many research for development interventions work in practice. The nested ToC offers a starting point for asking a different set of evaluation and research questions which may be more relevant to participatory research efforts working from within a complexity-aware, agricultural innovation systems perspective."

This study investigates future scenarios for development of shrimp aquaculture using a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) simulating farmers' production system choices. A role playing game (RPG) with farmers was used to calibrate and validate the model. Four scenarios, representing different visions of aquaculture in the next 15years, were elaborated with decision makers before discussing the different outputs of the model. Iterative consultation with farmers helped to fine-tune the model and identify key parameters and drivers in farmers' decision-making. The recursive process allowed us to construct a model that validly represents reality. Participants stated that use of the RPG improved their insight for planning. Results of the scenarios indicate that (i) intensification of production is unsustainable, (ii) market-based incentives are too limited to stimulate development of an integrated mangrove-shrimp production system and (iii) climate change will cause rapid decline of production in the absence of adaptation measures. RPG appeared to be a valuable method for formalizing local farmers' knowledge and integrating it into the planning approaches used by decision makers. The ABM, thus, can also be considered a medium or communication tool facilitating knowledge-sharing between farmers and decision makers."

abstract="Agricultural production in -open-sky systems- such as extensive cattle ranching on natural grasslands is subject to inter-annual climatic variability and other market fluctuations. To tackle the dependency of livestock breeding on these factors, we conducted participatory modeling with cattle producers in Uruguay. The methodology consists of simulating possible scenarios to collectively evaluate the different herd management practice alternatives. In this paper, we present an Agent-Based Model built with stakeholders and designed to represent a breeding system on a typical extensive grazing area in the basaltic soils region (BR) of Uruguay. This model has three main modules: environment, biophysical and decisional sub-models. This modularity allows the conducting of virtual experiments to reveal how some herd management decisions (such as seasonal stocking rate adjustments) combined with a climatic series can result in resilience against drought periods and market movements. Long-term simulations were implemented to analyze the sensitivity of the model to key management parameters with varying climate conditions. The inter-annual climatic variability can seriously affect cattle production, even with conservative stocking rates. Rigid strategies are bound to fail and cause systems to break. Adaptive management emerged as a critical option for the sustainability of livestock breeding. The inter-annual climatic variability can seriously affect cattle production, even with conservative stocking rates. This result highlights the importance of adaptive management, one that can react to a changing environment, for the sustainability of livestock breeding."

abstract="This study presents the use of a whole farm model in a participatory modelling research approach to examine the sensitivity of four contrasting case study farms to a likely climate change scenario. The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i.e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i.e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i.e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in rainfed cropping. The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic rainfed cropping farm and the least opportunistic rainfed cropping farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i.e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience."

This challenge is the target of collective action-based programs aiming at framing the cooperation context that would enable a local community to turn inherited resources and know-how into new market opportunities. Literature acknowledges that social capital is a crucial local resource for successful collective actions since it is a source of trust and collective commitment within a community. This paper deals with testing the role of this resource in the collective action case of the cheese producers in Aculco (Mexico). Focusing on the connectedness dimension of social capital, we propose an original methodology that relies on the multiplex and structural properties of social networks. This allows us to disentangle the opposite and ambivalent effects of social capital on the ability of a community to reach the goals assigned by the collective action program. Our empirical study shows that these critical properties can work in favor of adherence to collective action but can also create elite capture, clannish behaviors and entry barriers, thus showing a failure of collective action."

abstract="Agricultural systems face numerous sustainability challenges that require their ecological modernization. Strong changes in agricultural practices may require redesigning farming systems and involving local stakeholders in an agroecological transition. Development of Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems (ICLS) is a promising transition pathway. They can be developed at farm and territory levels by developing interactions between specialized farming systems. Designing ICLS at the territory level requires a systemic approach that considers social, technical and ecological issues from field and farm to territory levels. We present a participatory modeling approach for designing ICLS at the territory level in the Aveyron River basin (southwestern France), where arable farms experience significant sustainability issues due to intensive use of irrigation water and soil erosion, while livestock farms have significant feed self-sufficiency issues. We first quantified the amount of feed imported to livestock systems to determine the potential for local feed production. We designed alternative cropping systems with a group of arable farmers and technical advisors. The resulting options for change in land use and practices were simulated to assess the delivery of ecosystem services, socioeconomic performance and capacity to respond to water scarcity. The most promising option is the introduction of alfalfa into current cropping systems. This option reduces the use of inputs in cropping systems, in particular irrigation-water withdrawals, by up to 50{\%} without decreasing socioeconomic performance. Ecosystem services, in particular soil fertility maintenance and biological regulation, could be enhanced. Technical practices can be modified with the support of local supply chains, but require further support from public policies."

abstract="It has been suggested that during the first half of the 21st century food production will need to increase by 50-70{\%} using nearly the same amount of land, and under increasing pressures of climate change, to meet the demand of an increasingly crowded world. The challenge is significant, though there are also opportunities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where productivity gaps are largest. Here we report results from a participatory modeling exercise that aimed to identify feasible pathways for the sustainable intensification of agriculture in Manica Province, Mozambique. We used a combination of farmer questionnaires (n=52) and a cropping systems model (APSIM) to derive the likely causes and magnitude of existing gaps in maize yield, and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency. Results showed highly variable (i.e. season to season and site-to-site - 35{\%} and 42{\%} CV respectively) maize yields - regardless of nitrogen input use. Variability in soil fertility status and basic agronomic management (primarily sowing density) were the main drivers explaining site-to-site variability, while rainfall explained much of the season-to-season variability. Best-practice sowing densities (1 to 4.5pl./m2) were dependent on farmers' N inputs and agro-ecology. In most cases, the highest simulated yields were observed at sowing densities far below those recommended by the local extension services (4.4pl./m2). Estimates of returns on N inputs indicated that N fertilization was highly profitable for medium- and higher-performing farmers. Poor performing farmers could still make profits from investing in N fertilizers, but returns were lower than those of the better performers. We identified important knowledge gaps among the poorest performing smallholder. These gaps in knowledge related to simple principles of good agronomic practice - e.g. suitable plant populations, row spacing and sowing dates. We estimate that if these issues were addressed (i.e. with present levels of on farm investment) maize production could be increased by 120{\%} from 309kg/ha to 682kg/ha, among 17{\%} of the population of farmers. We also calculated that by re-investing a fraction (a third) of the proceeds from improving productivity, a further increase in productivity of 64{\%} could be achieved, lifting yields from 682kg/ha to 1118kg/ha. We conclude that as a first stepping stone in lifting productivity, focus should aim to provide the poorer performing farmers simple recommendations for basic agronomic management that account for the specificities of local climate and soil conditions, before costly technological innovations (e.g. fertilizers, herbicides) are introduced."

abstract="This article contributes to the debate on participatory approaches to bring about system changes that support sustainability and other broad innovation challenges. We report on experiences of workshops in two Dutch poultry subsectors where actors from the value chains together with a few other actors and facilitated by researchers, conducted an analysis of the structural barriers and windows of opportunity for innovation. In this way, we investigate the value of these collective system analyses in a wider approach for system innovation towards sustainable animal sectors. We expected that they would stimulate system learning among the participants: i.e. (1) recognising the multi-causality of recurrent problems, (2) redefining barriers into opportunities, and (3) designing options for collective action. The participants indeed recognised the integral and complex nature of the sustainability issues, and their commitment to sustainable development increased. However, the learning was limited in the sense that they defined few innovation opportunities and no options for collective actions. After analysing whether the workshops actively challenged the innovation barriers in the current subsectors, we conclude that the latter two dimensions of system learning seem to have been hindered by the representation of a large part of the value chains in the workshops.Our experiences provide new insights on how to stimulate a learning process geared towards overcoming lock-in in the incumbent production-consumption systems. Collective system analyses can be a relevant additional method for participatory innovation approaches. The innovation system perspective broadens the scope of the system and helps to distinguish the structures underlying current unsustainable practices. We suggest not seeking completeness by trying to bring all relevant value chain actors to the table at the same time, but rather organising multiple workshops with both value chain actors and innovating actors who operate more independently from the dominant system."

abstract="Agricultural intensification and abandonment have been identified as two of the more prominent and polarizing drivers of landscape change in Europe. These transitions may induce deterioration in landscape functioning and character, particularly in cultural landscapes demonstrative of evolving human-environment dynamics that have sustained environmental benefits through time. Cultural and behavioral motives are important root influences to such landscape transitions, yet efforts to address landscape degradation are often hampered by a failure to account for the heterogeneous decision-making nature of its agents of change and the inherent complexity of socio-ecological systems. Novel techniques are required to further disentangle responses to multi-level drivers and discuss alternative landscape development trajectories. Agent-based models constructed by means of participatory approaches present increasingly applied tools in this context. This study sought to capture and model the future perspectives emerging from presently occurring farming discourses in the region of Gera (Lesvos, Greece), characterized by persistent abandonment of its traditionally managed olive plantations. We constructed an agent-based model iteratively in collaboration with the local farming community and experts in landscape research. Empirical findings informed the model through the construction of a farmer typology, revealing a heavy reliance of the farming community upon sectorial profitability, prevalent cultural farming motives and emerging landscape initiatives. The model examined the de-coupled role of agricultural profitability and landscapes initiatives in shaping the behavior of land managers, mapping alternative landscape futures over a period of 25 years. Model results illustrate both increased profitability and action by landscape initiatives are required to reverse abandonment trends within the simulated time frame. The hypothesized ability of landscape initiatives to maintain and promote a cultural drive amongst adhering farmers is crucial for securing behavioral transformations towards professionalism. This study confirmed agent-based modelling to be intuitively received by stakeholders who significantly contributed to model structure refinement and the rejection of a status quo scenario."

This study reports the phases, results and implications of an extensive action research project, applying soft systems methodology, which aims to enhance regional forest programmes by facilitating increased use of collaborative decision support methods. Stakeholder feedback from demonstration meetings suggested that discussing alternative futures and prioritizing action proposals in a multi-stakeholder group through a simple multi-attribute rating technique are the most promising immediate enhancements. An ex-post evaluation of the suggested -ideal process model- showed that the deliberative nature of regional forest programmes had strengthened and that strategic and regional choices had become more prevalent in Finnish processes. The evaluation further underlined the need for simple, easily adoptable qualitative methods, but results remained ambiguous regarding potentials of quantitative, aggregative methods. Methodological developments cannot alone unlock central problems of the programme process, namely weak political capital and propensity toward status-quo, but the programme organisation is to be redefined as well."

abstract="Crop diversification is considered as a major lever to increase the sustainability of arable farming systems, allowing reduced inputs (irrigation water, pesticides, fertilizers), increasing the heterogeneity of habitat mosaics, or reducing yield gap associated with too frequent returns of the same species. To free up paths of collective action, this article highlights obstacles to crop diversification, existing at various levels of the value chains. We used a threefold approach: (i) a cross-cutting analysis of impediments to the development of 11 diversifying crops (5 species of grain legumes, alfalfa, flax, hemp, linseed, mustard, sorghum), based on published documents and on 30 interviews of stakeholders in French value chains; (ii) a detailed study (55 semi-structured surveys, including 39 farmers) of three value chains: pea and linseed for animal feed, hemp for insulation and biomaterials; and (iii) a bibliometric analysis of the technical journals and websites (180 articles) to characterize the nature of information diffused to farmers. We highlight that the development of minor crops is hindered by a socio-technical lock-in in favor of the dominant species (wheat, rapeseed, maize, etc.). We show for the first time that this lock-in is characterized by strongly interconnected impediments, occurring at every link of the value chains, such as lack of availability of improved varieties and methods of plant protection, scarcity of quantified references on crop successions, complexity of the knowledge to be acquired by farmers, logistical constraints to harvest collection, and difficulties of coordination within the emerging value chains. On the basis of this lock-in analysis, that could concern other European countries, the article proposes levers aimed at encouraging actors to incorporate a greater diversity of crops into their productive systems: adaptation of standards and labelling, better coordination between stakeholders to fairly share added value within value chains, and combination of genetic, agronomic, technological, and organizational innovations."

abstract="The development of future food systems will depend on normative decisions taken at different levels by policymakers and stakeholders. Scenario modeling is an adequate tool for assessing the implications of such decisions, but for an enlightened debate, it is important to make explicit and transparent how such value-based decisions affect modeling results. In a participatory approach working with five NGOs, we developed a future food vision for the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through an iterative process of defining the scenario, modeling, and revising the scenario, until a final future food vision was reached. The impacts on food production, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions, and the resulting diets in the food vision, were modeled using a mass flow model of the food system. The food vision formulated was an organic farming system where food is produced locally and livestock production is limited to -leftover streams,- i.e., by-products from food production and forage from pastures and perennial grass/clover mixtures, thus limiting food-feed competition. Consumption of meat, especially non-ruminant meat, was substantially reduced compared with current consumption in the Nordic countries (- 81{\%}). An estimated population of 37 million people could be supplied with the scenario diet, which uses 0.21 ha of arable land and causes greenhouse gas emissions of 0.48 tCO2e per diet and year. The novelty of this paper includes advancing modeling of sustainable food systems by using an iterative process for designing future food visions based on stakeholder values, which enables results from multidisciplinary modeling (including agronomy, environmental system analysis, animal and human nutrition) to be fed back into the decision-making process, providing an empirical basis for normative decisions and a science-based future vision of sustainable food systems."

abstract="This paper reflects on collaborative landscape research conducted in Reunion Island, an outermost region of the European Union. On this 2,500 km2 tropical island also considered a major international biodiversity hotspot, land-use planners must address important challenges, especially growing population densities and urban sprawl that cause important pressure on agricultural land and natural ecosystems. While progress has been made towards land-use zoning and planning at the island scale, entrenched interests and a lack of communication between the agricultural, urban and environmental sectors continue to hinder the design and implementation of integrated land-use plans at the local level. This paper presents an approach to territorial foresight where urban development scenarios and spatial models were co-constructed with a collective of institutional actors in order to facilitate dialogue on future urbanization patterns and impacts on landscapes. It describes how spatially explicit models and simulations of urban development, first used as demonstrators, have raised individual interests and expectations and facilitated the structuring of a collaborative research network. Models and scenarios were then questioned, redesigned collectively and used as boundary objects to facilitate a shift away from statistical and sectorial readings towards more territorialized and integrated perspectives. Analysing inputs, reactions and feedback from the actors involved in the research, this paper discusses the role and potential value of landscape modelling and simulation in mediating debates among planning stakeholders and creating social learning situations."

Yet this process can be challenging, particularly as practitioners and policy makers grapple with different conservation objectives and a diverse landscape of relevant stakeholders. Here we draw on social network theory and methods to develop guidelines for selecting -key players- better positioned to successfully implement four distinct conservation objectives: (1) rapid diffusion of conservation information, (2) diffusion between disconnected groups, (3) rapid diffusion of complex knowledge or initiatives, or (4) widespread diffusion of conservation information or complex initiatives over a longer time period. Using complete network data among coastal fishers from six villages in Kenya, we apply this approach to select key players for each type of conservation objective. We then draw on key informant interviews from seven resource management and conservation organizations working along the Kenyan coast to investigate whether the socioeconomic attributes of the key players we identified match the ones typically selected to facilitate conservation diffusion (i.e., -current players-). Our findings show clear discrepancies between current players and key players, highlighting missed opportunities for progressing more effective conservation diffusion. We conclude with specific criteria for selecting key stakeholders to facilitate each distinct conservation objective, thereby helping to mitigate the problem of stakeholder identification in ways that avoid blueprint approaches. These guidelines can also be applied in other research and intervention areas, such as community development studies, participatory research, and community intervention."

By taking a fragile socio-ecological lagoon system in Southern Mexico as a case study, the paper applies a social network analytical approach to: i) reveal the actual web of connections tying stakeholders through local governance arrangements; ii) identify shortcomings in multi-actor collaboration networks; and iii) propose ways to tackle them so that the full potential of adaptation can be exploited. The paper employs a mixed-method approach combining both a quantitative and qualitative Social Network Analysis (SNA). The quantitative SNA is used to assess the quality and strength of relationships among formal public organisations working on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the site. The qualitative SNA is employed to both assess linking ties between formal organizations and local coastal communities potentially targeted with adaptation interventions, and bonding ties connecting community members. The approach proves to be useful to map the relational architecture of the system of interest and to reveal network characteristics that are important for collective action including: network fragmentation in subgroups; density of relations; centralization around a few actors. The actual topology of the network, as revealed, can then be compared with what is required for achieving societally desired adaptation outcomes and for identifying agents that can promote change. The paper acknowledges that a social analytical approach might be limited in unveiling the interests and motives behind actors- participation in the network, and that the latter ultimately determine actors- contribution in defining and enacting a joint solution for a common problem. However, the mixed-methods approach presented in this paper allows for gaining first insights on the way a mismatch between formal and informal institutions might drive socio-ecological systems towards inadequate adaptation outcomes."

The paper's main aim is to describe how social learning and collaborative decision making can be realised as part of participatory governance and how they can be supported by socio-technical approaches and instruments. We describe the socio-technical approach of collaborative modelling (CM), and features of the web-based tools for supporting social learning and collaborative decision making, which were developed and tested in a case study on FRM in Northern Germany. The underlying framework of CM is described and the different phases with regard to stakeholder interaction are illustrated. The CM tools are described and reflected against a set of six criteria for cognitive learning in social learning processes. We illustrate how they can support learning about: (a) the status of the problem; (b) possible solutions and the accompanying consequences; (c) other peoples- and groups- interests and values; (d) one's own personal interests; (e) methods, tools, and strategies for better communication; and (f) practicing, using and applying holistic and integrative thinking."

abstract="Scenario planning helps managers incorporate climate change into their natural resource decision making through a structured -what-if- process of identifying key uncertainties and potential impacts and responses. Although qualitative scenarios, in which ecosystem responses to climate change are derived via expert opinion, often suffice for managers to begin addressing climate change in their planning, this approach may face limits in resolving the responses of complex systems to altered climate conditions. In addition, this approach may fall short of the scientific credibility managers often require to take actions that differ from current practice. Quantitative simulation modeling of ecosystem response to climate conditions and management actions can provide this credibility, but its utility is limited unless the modeling addresses the most impactful and management-relevant uncertainties and incorporates realistic management actions. We use a case study to compare and contrast management implications derived from qualitative scenario narratives and from scenarios supported by quantitative simulations. We then describe an analytical framework that refines the case study-s integrated approach in order to improve applicability of results to management decisions. The case study illustrates the value of an integrated approach for identifying counterintuitive system dynamics, refining understanding of complex relationships, clarifying the magnitude and timing of changes, identifying and checking the validity of assumptions about resource responses to climate, and refining management directions. Our proposed analytical framework retains qualitative scenario planning as a core element because its participatory approach builds understanding for both managers and scientists, lays the groundwork to focus quantitative simulations on key system dynamics, and clarifies the challenges that subsequent decision making must address."

abstract="Mainstreaming climate change and future uncertainty into rural development planning in developing countries is a pressing challenge. By taking a complex systems approach to decision-making, the adaptation pathways construct provides useful principles. However, there are no examples of how to operationalise adaptation pathways in developing countries, or how to evaluate the process. This paper describes a 4year governance experiment in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, which applied adaptive co-management (ACM) as a governance approach to -prime- a transformation to adaptation pathways-based development planning. The project-s Theory of Change (ToC) consisted of three causally-linked phases which mirrored the evolutionary stages of ACM: priming stakeholders, enabling policies and programs, and implementing adaptation. The first phase established a trans-disciplinary research team to act as facilitators and brokers, a multi-stakeholder planning process demonstrating adaptation pathways practice, and trialling of -no regrets- adaptation strategies in case study sub-districts. A participatory evaluation method was designed to test the ToC-s assumptions and measure ACM outcomes. Stakeholder interviews at the project-s closure indicated that through ACM, stakeholders had been successfully primed: leaders emerged, trust, cross-scale social networks and knowledge integration grew, communities were empowered, and innovative adaptation strategies were developed and tested. However, there was limited evidence of institutional change to existing planning processes. This was attributed to the absence of policy windows due to ineffective and insufficient time for political engagement, and the fluid institutional environment caused by a national decentralisation policy. To enhance the priming of adaptation pathways into development planning under these conditions, three recommendations are made: (1) provide long term support for emergent leaders and brokers to become -policy entrepreneurs- who can capitalise on policy windows when they appear, (2) establish and support local livelihood innovation niches as -bridgeheads- for ACM, and (3) maintain participatory evaluation amongst primary stakeholders to re-kindle ACM."

A successful participatory process requires a thorough analysis of stakeholders- perceptions and preferences. The aim of this paper is to investigate the differences between stakeholders- perceived influence and real power in forest management. A questionnaire survey was carried out among 51 forest stakeholders in a case study in the Italian Alps. Perceived influence was measured by asking stakeholders to rate on a 5-point scale the extent to which they can influence forest management issues. Real power was analyzed using social network analysis (SNA), investigating the relationships that stakeholders have with each other in the network. Real power was measured using a Freeman-s degree centrality measure, which focuses on the direct ties coming in and out for each stakeholder. The results show that public administration is the category of stakeholders with the most power in all forest management issues, while the actors of the tourism sector are in a marginal position. In addition, the results of the study suggest that in many cases stakeholders have a distorted perception of their own power."

abstract="Participatory modeling has been widely recognized in recent years as a powerful tool for dealing with risk and uncertainty. By incorporating multiple perspectives into the structure of a model, we hypothesize that sources of risk can be identified and analyzed more comprehensively compared to traditional -expert-driven- models. However, one of the weaknesses of a participatory modeling process is that it is typically not feasible to involve more than a few dozen people in model creation, and valuable perspectives on sources of risk may therefore be absent. We sought to address this weakness by conducting parallel participatory modeling processes in three countries in West Africa with similar climates and smallholder agricultural systems, but widely differing political and cultural contexts. Stakeholders involved in the agricultural sector in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria participated in either a scenario planning process or a causal loop diagramming process, in which they were asked about drivers of agricultural productivity and food security, and sources of risk, including climate risk, between the present and mid-century (2035-2050). Participants in all three workshops identified both direct and indirect sources of climate risk, as they interact with other critical drivers of agricultural systems change, such as water availability, political investment in agriculture, and land availability. We conclude that participatory systems methods are a valuable addition to the suite of methodologies for analyzing climate risk and that scientists and policy-makers would do well to consider dynamic interactions between drivers of risk when assessing the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change."

pages="711-726",
abstract="A key aim of transdisciplinary research is for actors from science, policy and practice to co-evolve their understanding of a social-ecological issue, reconcile their diverse perspectives and co-produce appropriate knowledge to serve a common purpose. With its concurrent grounding in practice and science, transdisciplinary research represents a significant departure from conventional research. We focus on mutual learning within transdisciplinary research and highlight three aspects that could guide other researchers in designing and facilitating such learning. These are: -who to learn with-, -what to learn about- and -how to learn-. For each of these questions, we present learning heuristics that are supported by a comparative analysis of two case studies that addressed contemporary conservation issues in South Africa but varied in scale and duration. These were a five-year national-scale project focusing on the prioritisation of freshwater ecosystems for conservation and a three-year local-scale project that used ecological infrastructure as a theme for advancing sustainability dialogues. Regarding the proposed learning heuristics, -who to learn with- is scale dependent and needs to be informed by relevant disciplines and policy sectors with the aim of establishing a knowledge network representing empirical, pragmatic, normative and purposive functions. This emergent network should be enriched by involving relevant experts, novices and bridging agents, where possible. It is important for such networks to learn about the respective histories, system processes and drivers, values and knowledge that exist in the social-ecological system of interest. Moreover, learning together about key concepts and issues can help to develop a shared vocabulary, which in turn can contribute to a shared understanding, a common vision and an agreed way of responding to it. New ways of group learning can be promoted and enhanced by co-developing outputs (boundary objects) for application across knowledge domains and creating spaces (third places) that facilitate exchange of knowledge and knowledge co-production. We conclude with five generic lessons for transdisciplinary researchers to enhance project success: (a) the duration, timing and continuation potential of a project influences its prospects for achieving systemic and sustainable change; (b) bridging agents, especially if embedded within an implementing agency, play a critical role in facilitating transdisciplinary learning with enhanced outcomes; (c) researchers need to participate as co-learners rather than masters of knowledge domains; (d) purposeful mixed-paradigm research designs could help to mend knowledge fragmentation within science; and (e) researchers must be vigilant for three pitfalls in mutual learning initiatives, namely biases in participant self-selection, perceived superiority of scientific knowledge and the attraction of simple solutions to wicked problems that retain the status quo."

The migratory corridors, feeding, resting and calving sites which are used for whale watching may be influenced by changing ocean currents and water temperatures. Here, we used an innovative approach addressing the emerging issue of climate change on the whale watch industry. This involved participatory modelling using key stakeholders for the whale watching industry to develop a systems conceptualisation model for evaluating the potential effects of climate change based on a case study from the east coast of Australia. This participatory approach allowed us to identify the causal linkages (including feedback pathways) between different cOppElementscOpp of the system within which the whale watching industry operates. It also allowed us to integrate multiple drivers covering socio-economic and environmental aspects including climate change (e.g. temperature), policy (e.g. number of boats), ecology (e.g. number of whales) and socio-economics (e.g. number of tourists) to evaluate the changes in the overall system. We then developed a Bayesian belief network model from the systems conceptualisation on which stakeholders identified a priority issue (Profitability). Stakeholders provided the structure and the quantification of this model, and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to help identify important intervention points for the industry. Overall, our research illustrates how such a modelling process can assist local tourism operators and authorities in making rational management decisions within a holistic or systems-based framework and its approach is applicable to other regions."

abstract="Tam Hoa plum is one of three hybrids of the Japanese plum (Prunus salicina), originating from southern China, and grown between 700 and1000 m altitude in north-west Vietnam for the domestic market. Along with some leguminous crops grown in rotation with maize, plums are an important source of additional income for smallholders. The aim of the project was to develop competitive value chains for plums with high levels of smallholder engagement. The research design was both structured and adaptive, based on participative action research. In addition, sensory evaluation to determine optimum measurable indicators of ripeness (soluble solids and hardness) based on consumer preferences was conducted to adjust time of harvesting. The research found that Tam Hoa plum production and marketing is a large, complex system that is interconnected with the marketing of green (immature) plums to China and other substitutable fruit such as lychees, longans and other plums. It is a highly opportunistic, low-input system the outputs of which depend on plum prices, the relative production capability of districts and local microclimates. The 40- to 45-day plum harvest season is highly variable regarding harvesting dates, harvest duration, plum quality and, consequently, market prices. It was established that there is sufficient profit margin for all chain participants to establish a sustainable niche value chain based on high-quality sweet plums if reliable and sufficient throughput can be achieved. It is recommended that future similar value chain projects pay particular attention to selecting large 'aggregators' and 'distributors' so as to achieve volume and stable market access.",

abstract="In several countries, it has been observed that development of policies and regulations for non-timber forest products (NTFPs) rarely follows a systematic approach. This paper characterises the diversity of governance arrangements for accessing and marketing indigenous natural products in communal areas of Namibia. Applying concepts from environmental governance, two main types of governance arrangements for accessing NTFPs are distinguished, i.e. community-level self-organised governance and network governance between the state and local communities. Application of the theory of global value chain governance reveals three main types of governance arrangements for accessing NTFP markets. These are: (1) market value chains for coordinating access to informal domestic markets, (2) captive value chains and (3) quasi-hierarchical value chains for accessing global markets. The arrangements for accessing resources and markets are further integrated into three main modes of NTFP governance in Namibia, i.e. network governance with high degree of state involvement; network governance with low degree of state involvement and active involvement of local communities and civil society; and a community-based self-organised governance at local level with dominance of local authorities. Considering this differentiated governance approach, there is scope for the development of an integrated policy framework that recognises NTFPs based on the different governance arrangements."

abstract="This article explores the emergence and co-production of cOppconnectivity conservationcOpp in Australia. Connectivity conservation seeks to restore ecological connectivity at a landscape scale through collaborative conservation. Claims that connectivity conservation will connect landscapes and communities resonate powerfully throughout the Australian conservation community. This metaphor is part of a broader science narrative that shifts connectivity from a descriptive ecological concept to one imbued with normative claims about the inherent value of collaboration and large intact landscapes. In a relatively short period, this narrative has taken hold. The Federal Government developed a National Wildlife Corridors Plan and there are now connectivity initiatives in every Australian state. When stabilized in the Australian landscape, the concept of connectivity as come to embody much more than the original scientific interpretation of the terminology. This expanded focus has been core to the popularization of the practice of connectivity conservation, however it has raised concerns within certain academic communities about the scientific rigor underpinning these new efforts. This article analyses cOppconnectivitycOpp as a boundary object, and an emergent science narrative that has united diverse and conflicting perspectives. In this case, the interplay between science, policy, and practice produced significant policy outcomes despite a somewhat contested debate about the relationship between connectivity science and the practice of connectivity conservation. As connectivity science and practice co-evolve, there are growing calls to support collaborative knowledge production. This paper draws on Jasanoff's critical analytical understanding of co-production to highlight the importance of understanding the social and normative dimensions in instrumental efforts to co-produce knowledge."

abstract="Coastal island communities face significant risks associated with increased natural hazards and other impacts associated with climate change. Further, deeply rooted social issues, lack of awareness or information, and inadequate infrastructure and planning may exacerbate risks to island socio-ecological systems. Understanding these relationships is often difficult, given the lack of methods available for communities to explicitly explore anticipated risks and potential adaptation strategies, in relation to the characteristics of their community socio-ecological system. Social learning has also been shown to foster adaptation to environmental changes, build social trust and empower diverse stakeholders, by offering opportunities for groups of individuals to challenge, negotiate and propose new norms, policies or programs. We present a three-phase social learning framework to facilitate stakeholder-driven scenario-based modeling, in order to inform community disaster planning in relation to the potential impacts of a tsunami. The participatory research was conducted in conjunction with a community disaster committee, representing the communities of the North Shore of OcOppahu, HawaicOppi. Through a series of iterative participatory modeling workshops using fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, the community committee represented, explored and actively questioned their beliefs about the natural hazards that their community faces. Further, the modeling process allowed the committee to represent the communitiescOpp dynamic nature, run tsunami hazard scenarios to quantify potential direct and indirect effects, and explicitly compare trade-offs of competing adaptation strategies. Changes in the committee's model representations that took place over time demonstrate a progression through single-, double- and triple-loop learning, indicating that social learning occurred across individual to institutional levels, and over short- to long-term time scales."

In Quebec, Canada watershed organizations are in the process of implementing participatory based watershed planning and management schemes. However, there is a lack of simple and readily implementable frameworks and methods to explicitly involve stakeholders, as well as integrate physical and social processes, in watershed planning and management in Quebec. This paper describes the application of the first three stages of a newly proposed five stage stepwise Participatory Model Building framework that was developed to help facilitate the participatory investigation of problems in watershed planning and management through the use of qualitative system dynamics models. In the agriculturally intensive Du Chene watershed in Quebec, eight individual stakeholder interviews were conducted in cooperation with the local watershed organization to develop qualitative system dynamics models that represent the main physical and social processes in the Du Chene watershed. The proposed Participatory Model Building framework was found to be accessible for all the interviewees, and was deemed to be very useful by the watershed organization to develop an overview of the different perspectives of the main stakeholders in the watershed, as well as to help develop watershed policies and strategies. The individual qualitative system dynamics models developed in this study can subsequently be converted into an overall group built system dynamics model (describing the socio-economic-political components of the watershed), which in turn can be quantified and coupled with a physically based model such as HEC-HMS or SWAT (describing the physical components of the watershed)."

abstract="In developing countries adaptation responses to climate and global change should be integrated with human development to generate no regrets, co-benefit strategies for the rural poor, but there are few examples of how to achieve this. The adaptation pathways approach provides a potentially useful decision-making framework because it aims to steer societies towards sustainable futures by accounting for complex systems, uncertainty and contested multi-stakeholder arenas, and by maintaining adaptation options. Using Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, as an example we consider whether generic justifications for adaptation pathways are tenable in the local context of climate and global change, rural poverty and development. Interviews and focus groups held with a cross-section of provincial leaders showed that the causes of community vulnerability are indeed highly complex and dynamic, influenced by 20 interacting drivers, of which climate variability and change are only two. Climate change interacts with population growth and ecosystem degradation to reduce land, water and food availability. Although poverty is resilient due to corruption, traditional institutions and fatalism, there is also considerable system flux due to decentralisation, modernisation and erosion of traditional culture. Together with several thresholds in drivers, potential shocks and paradoxes, these characteristics result in unpredictable system trajectories. Decision-making is also contested due to tensions around formal and informal leadership, corruption, community participation in planning and female empowerment. Based on this context we propose an adaptation pathways approach which can address the proximate and systemic causes of vulnerability and contested decision-making. Appropriate participatory processes and governance structures are suggested, including integrated livelihoods and multi-scale systems analysis, scenario planning, adaptive co-management and cOpplivelihood innovation nichescOpp. We briefly discuss how this framing of adaptation pathways would differ from one in the developed context of neighbouring Australia, including the influence of the province's island geography on the heterogeneity of livelihoods and climate change, the pre-eminence and rapid change of social drivers, and the necessity to cOppleap-frogcOpp the Millennium Development Goals by mid-century to build adaptive capacity for imminent climate change impacts."

abstract="Engineers have always had to deal with complex challenges. However, a profound change has occurred over the last two decades with a realization of the need to transition from a focus on technical issues to sustainability problems that require an integrated, adaptive and participatory approach. Such an engineering approach does not only necessitate new methods and tools, but also the consideration of epistemology to deal with different kinds of knowledge and high uncertainties. The concept of paradigms can support the case-specific analysis of concrete solution strategies based upon an understanding of the epistemological dimension of sustainability issues. A systematic and integrated discussion of paradigms and their interactions in engineering practice is currently lacking in the scientific literature. This paper examines the role of paradigms in engineering practice and presents a system science approach for the analysis of paradigms. A case study on sustainable flood management and a literature analysis are provided to show the relevance of multiple paradigms in sustainable development issues. Engineers should be aware of paradigms and their respective application context, as well as the particular role of the cOppcommunity involvementcOpp paradigm for sustainable development.

An overview and some reflections on the experiences of the authors in the teaching of these new paradigms at McGill University, Canada, and the University of Osnabrueck, Germany, are provided. In particular, group model building exercises were found to provide students with important experiences regarding stakeholder interaction in the safe space of the classroom."

In this paper, we focus on the use of PM to support the development of the integrated regional modeling system DANUBIA as a scientific concept to analyze the previously unknown impacts of global change, i.e., the combined effects of climate, demographic, economic, social and ecological change, on the Upper Danube Catchment (Germany). We use this case study to examine the specific conditions for PM in the field of complex integrated models on a regional scale. We describe the stepwise PM process and discuss the respective results, focusing on (1) the stakeholder dialoguecOpps contribution in supporting the development of new, complex modeling systems, particularly on a regional scale, (2) conditions of stakeholder involvement in issues related to the distant future, such as climate change impacts on regional water availability, and (3) limitations of PM and scientistscOpp motivation to carry out participatory research at all. We conclude that the PM process was not entirely successful in improving the scientific quality and practical applicability of the developed models because the process goals were manifold and overambitious, and the definition of the problem of cOppglobal change impacts on a regional scalecOpp was too weak and uncertain to allow for a clear common objective of modelers and stakeholders.

abstract="The increasing diversity of stakeholders, who often hold differing and conflicting land-use perceptions and strategies, underlines the growing need for innovative methods and tools to support a negotiation process aimed at an enhanced and more decentralised land-use management policy. Land-use management is a complex issue and thus presents an irreducible uncertainty that entails a variety of legitimate perspectives. Due to this complexity, the decision-making process should be incremental, iterative and continuous. This means that the acts of decision making will always be imperfect but will move progressively closer towards a shared satisfactory resolution. However, which tools will best fit such a theoretical starting point? Our team is seeking to develop an innovative form of participatory modelling fitting these hypotheses. As regards regional planning, a novel way to put these assumptions into practice has been under way since 1997 in the Senegal River Valley. This experiment, called ``SelfCormas'', is being conducted to test a directed self-designing of modelling tools, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by stakeholders and principals. From the initial stages, as little prior design work as possible is executed by the modellers. The process has been organised in the form of participatory workshops, including role-playing games, to support a local decentralisation policy at an operational level (2,500 km2). This sort of accompaniment leads to discussions, appraisals and decisions concerning the planning of land-use management. Just a few months after the first workshops, this process has already culminated in autonomous applications, from local to regional levels."

However, simulation models need to gain stakeholders' acceptance before they will be utilized. Gaining stakeholders' acceptance likely requires salience, credibility and legitimacy. We surveyed the perceptions and expectations of 122 potential model users in four countries, prioritizing these model attributes. A possible shift in user perception was assessed during a participatory model evaluation of a resource management model (FALLOW) for post-tsunami development in West Aceh (Indonesia). Potential model users, comprising natural resource managers, policy makers, lecturers and scientists, ranked salience as the most important characteristic for an integrated simulation model, followed by credibility and legitimacy. Model users occupation, prior exposure and interest in using a simulation model did not have a statistically significant influence on users perceptions of model attributes.",

abstract="Decision support systems (DSSs) are one of the ways in which agricultural scientists have attempted to make agricultural systems science more accessible to farmers and to foster innovation. Recently, there has been a shift towards more participatory processes in development and application of DSSs to enhance their end-user use. Apart from increasing adoption, these participatory processes are also likely to enhance co-learning resulting from development/application of DSSs. Learning is a valuable process in increasing sustainability of natural resource management, so the application of DSSs in a learning context can make a contribution to the global challenges faced by agriculture. We developed a framework, using concepts drawn from social studies of science and technology, describing the phases of the participatory DSS development/application process and its likely outcomes. We analysed experiences of participants in a case study exploring more sustainable management of nitrogen fertilizer in sugarcane production in an environmentally sensitive area of northeastern Australia. The data illustrate theoretical constructs underpinning the framework and learning processes within the case study. The framework and case study results demonstrate the value of participatory DSS development/application as a co-learning process, an outcome not traditionally valued by agricultural DSS developers and one that is likely to help address the challenges faced by agricultural sustainability.",

abstract="Extensive resources are allocated to managing vertebrate pests, yet spatial understanding of pest threats, and how they respond to management, is limited at the regional scale where much decision-making is undertaken. We provide regional-scale spatial models and management guidance for European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a 260,791pkmpo region in Australia by determining habitat suitability, habitat susceptibility and the effects of the primary rabbit management options (barrier fence, shooting and baiting and warren ripping) or changing predation or disease control levels. A participatory modelling approach was used to develop a Bayesian network which captured the main drivers of suitability and spread, which in turn was linked spatially to develop high resolution risk maps. Policy-makers, rabbit managers and technical experts were responsible for defining the questions the model needed to address, and for subsequently developing and parameterising the model. Habitat suitability was determined by conditions required for warren-building and by above-ground requirements, such as food and harbour, and habitat susceptibility by the distance from current distributions, habitat suitability, and the costs of traversing habitats of different quality. At least one-third of the region had a high probability of being highly suitable (support high rabbit densities), with the model supported by validation. Habitat susceptibility was largely restricted by the current known rabbit distribution. Warren ripping was the most effective control option as warrens were considered essential for rabbit persistence. The anticipated increase in disease resistance was predicted to increase the probability of moderately suitable habitat becoming highly suitable, but not increase the at-risk area. We demonstrate that it is possible to build spatial models to guide regional-level management of vertebrate pests which use the best available knowledge and capture fine spatial-scale processes."

Collectors were vulnerable to state regulations that constrained their access to bay leaves in reserve forests and to MAPs markets that were established by the Government in the lowlands. To address these constraints, policy readjustments through three independent but interlinked value chain (VC) upgrading strategies comprising of VC coordination upgrading, horizontal coordination and streamlined marketing were implemented together with stakeholders. Information was collected from focus group discussions with collectors, traders and facilitators in bay leaf VC and a questionnaire was used to collect pre- and post-intervention data (n = 139) to analyse the impact on resource management and household incomes. Findings show horizontal coordination that increased awareness and ownership of collectors led to adoption of improved harvesting and management practices. Streamlined marketing through local auctions reduced collectors' risks and led to a three-fold increase in price at the village, which increased household income. VC coordination strategies enabled piloting a pro-poor VC governance system. Local auctions are a crucial but missing function in the MAPs VC in Uttarakhand that should be incorporated in MAPs marketing polices. The study's findings and approach can be upscaled to other MAPs for benefiting a large number of people and ecosystems in Uttarakhand and beyond and contribute to the debate on green economy in mountains."

Crop-livestock integration is a possible solution for the sustainable intensification of farming systems. GAMEDE, a whole-farm model, was designed and used with six representative dairy farmers on the island to ex-ante assess differences in farm sustainability of various degrees of crop-livestock integration and to support discussions with farmers about these options. The model details the dynamics of the main biophysical and decisional processes affecting labour, gross margin, and energy and nutrient flows within the farm. We propose a method based on typology, modelling and participatory techniques to support policy making. All its methodological stages integrate both quantitative and qualitative data. The large majority of farm model implementation cases reported in the literature refers to constructed synthetic farms. However, in our case, actual farm simulation was particularly useful for capturing farmers expert knowledge and providing insights into how agro-ecosystems are really managed. This approach enabled taking farm diversity into account in defining relevant interventions. The reliability of extrapolations and recommendations for policy formulation based on farm-level simulation were verified by a rigorous evaluation of the representativeness of the farm sample, crossing expert data with data stemming from a multi-variate analysis. Our research indicates that actual farms can also be typical.",

We present a case study of participatory model evaluation for an agent-based model designed to examine the impacts of land-use/cover change on wildfire regimes for a region of Spain. Although model output was endorsed by interviewees as credible, several alterations to model structure were suggested. Of broader interest, we found that some interviewees conflated model structure with scenario boundary conditions. If an interactive participatory modelling approach is not possible, an emphasis on ensuring that stakeholders understand the distinction between model structure and scenario boundary conditions will be particularly important."

abstract="To improve sustainability, farmers may want to redesign their livestock farming systems in depth. Systemic modelling has proved an efficient tool to study complex issues regarding farming systems, but it remains inefficient to support farmers in their system redesign processes. This paper describes and discusses a novel method to model livestock farming systems with groups of farmers to help them redesign their own systems. Modelling livestock farming systems at the farm scale with farmer groups is an original approach in livestock farming system modelling. Following a constructivist approach, our method involves working with farmers already involved in redesign processes and building causal maps according to their own representations, without using models previously created by scientists. Applying the method, we built two causal maps of livestock farming system operation, each one built with a group of five farmers including both those converting and converted to organic farming. Converting to organic farming was considered as one example of a redesign process. On the basis of a subjective assessment by both the participating farmers and researchers, and an analysis of map structures, we assessed the methods strengths and weaknesses. We considered that one of its main advantages lay in its collective dimension: sharing, comparing and questioning interested the participating farmers greatly; however, it requires good facilitation skills and suitable group composition. Furthermore, the formalising process identified, for example, vicious circles in system operation, which made the farmers think about solutions for breaking them. Finally, analysis of map structures identified similarities and differences between the two groups that were discussed with both of them during a final workshop; this activity continued farmers self-reflection about their systems, which may help lead to innovative and more sustainable livestock farming systems."

All stages of the study are presented beginning with the initial creation of a systems model of the industry in collaboration with the tourism industry, government agencies and the wider community in Stage 1. The process of engaging support for Stage 2 is described and attempts to refine the components of the model and develop an information system in the second stage are outlined. Neither a refinement of the tourism simulator model nor a functional information system were achieved, although extensive information was gathered and interpreted as part of the process. The outcomes were constrained by institutional difficulties despite clear goodwill among the participants. Contrary to expectations, data that would help build the sub-models were not found. An events and attractions investment sub-model was developed as fully as possible to explore data constraints. Information provided by interviewees was synthesised as far as possible to develop relationships describing economic impacts, but different ways of estimating outcomes were not compatible, even within a single sub-model. A review of recent literature showed that effective modelling required much more sophisticated data gathering than was possible within this study to indicate sustainable yield from different investment strategies. The study provided a practical demonstration of the challenges involved in genuinely engaging a regional rangeland community in industry and regional development, and the limited benefits of systems dynamics modelling, especially where resources and data are constrained. A useful outcome was the identification of the particular activities which elicited the greatest response from participants - the systems workshops, trialling the demonstration tourism simulator and one-on-one sharing of information. These should form the basis of future community involvement in regional development rather than any attempt to refine modelling tools.",

abstract="Adding a dynamic, temporal dimension to the calculation of nitrogen balances is proposed as an alternative approach to assessing the impact of crop and soil management decisions on the establishment of farmer-induced soil fertility gradients within smallholder African farms. A simulation model that operates at field scale (DYNBAL-N: DYnamic simulation of Nutrient BALances) was used to understand the mechanisms leading to differences in resource use efficiency within a farm. We focused on N balances and use efficiencies, as the advantages of increasing the complexity of the calculations by considering the dynamics of the system (relative to the widely-used static approach) are expected to be large for a highly mobile nutrient such as N. The model was tested against a wide range of maize yield data (0.2-3.4 t ha superscript -1(B) from on-farm measurements undertaken in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts), producing reasonably accurate predictions (r superscript 2(B = 0.72). Simulation scenarios were selected by considering multiple sources of variability affecting the N balances for typical households in Shinyalu, western Kenya, using field data collected by means of interviews, participatory resource flow mapping, soil sampling and laboratory analysis. The simulation results indicated that the use efficiencies of the biophysical resources radiation, water and N varied across the different fields of the farms, strongly affected by management decisions and soil fertility status. N balances varied between -38.0 and 21.9 kg N ha superscript -1(B for the different crop and soil management scenarios. The main N flows explaining the magnitude and the sign of the N balances were N removal by harvest, and N losses by leaching (2.3-18.3 kg ha superscript -1(B) and by soil erosion (0.6-14.9 kg ha superscript -1(B). Different options for soil fertility management (N fertilisation rates, manure applications) were then explored for different field types within a farm using the model. The use efficiency of the N applied as mineral fertiliser varied between 15.2 and 48.4 kg grain kg superscript -1(B applied N for different crop and soil management scenarios. The results illustrated the advantages of including the temporal dimensions and considering the spatial variability in the calculation of nutrient balances, when realistic scenarios are analysed. These results also indicated that nutrient balances at field scale are of limited value as indicators of resource use efficiency, and that nutrient stocks and corresponding crop yields need to be taken into account.",

abstract="Arable land in western Kenya is under considerable pressure from increasing human population. Rural households depend on farming for at least part of their livelihood, and poverty rates are among the highest in Kenya. Land is often depleted of nutrients, and for most farmers, access to inputs and markets is poor. There is a need to identify options that are manageable within the context of the farmer's resource base and the household's objectives that could improve farm household well-being. In this study we integrated qualitative informal participatory approaches with quantitative mathematical programming and biophysical simulation modelling. Households in four sub-locations in Vihiga District were clustered and pilot cases identified. Meetings were held with farmers to elicit their perceptions of what their ideal farm would look like, and how its performance might compare with their own farm's performance. With farmers' help, a range of scenarios was analysed, relating to changes in current enterprise mixes, changes in current farm sizes, and changes in prices of staples foods and cash crops. A considerable mismatch was found between farmers' estimates of their own farm's performance, and what was actually produced. There seems to be a threshold in farm size of 0.4 ha, below which it is very difficult for households to satisfy their income and food security objectives. Even for larger farms whose households are largely dependent on agriculture, the importance of a cash crop in the system is critical. There is a crucial role for extension services in making farmers aware of the potential impacts on farm revenue of modest changes in their farm management systems. We are monitoring nine households in the district, whose farmers have made some changes to their system in an attempt to increase household income and enhance food security.",

The master plan emphasizes people-centred development initiatives that link livestock development to the social, economic and environmental context in Nepal. Reflections on the experience highlight (a) the effectiveness of the initial systems-learning workshops in achieving local participation; (b) the usefulness of soft systems techniques in guiding the transformation of the shared vision that emerged into a concept to guide future development; (c) the difficulty of achieving and maintaining local participation and the effect of not doing so; (d) the adequacy of the methodology in addressing social power issues; (e) the need to mesh changes at the institutional and field levels. The authors conclude it is unlikely that sufficient momentum was generated to achieve the major shift in institutional strategy the master plan calls for and they discuss participative action research as a strategy for achieving the necessary continuity and iteration, mediated by critical reflection, between planning and action.",

Building on these and the outcome of a four-year action research programme, it provides a model which has potential for use by other professions. It has been tailored here to suit training and learning systems. Design/methodology/approach: The action research was carried out over a four-year period. It used ethnographic principles and involved immersion in the community and engagement and participation at various levels and sectors. The objective was to discover the applicability of quality principles at community level. Findings: The outcomes of the research are twofold. First, the Grange excellence model (GEM) provides a framework for all human activity systems. Second, a definition of excellence provides a generic code of practice for all human engagement. Both are applicable to all human activity in pursuit of any goal or objective. Practical implications: Research outcomes are fractal and generic in nature, allowing them to be applied without limitation to all human activity at individual, interest group, industry or institution level. This paper describes how it might be used in training and learning systems. Originality/value: The introduction of the term ``cystem'' provides a new unique concept for profiling human activity. The GEM provides a realistic model of real world human engagement not found in either the European Foundation's Quality Management (EFQM) or Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) models.

abstract="Constructivist pedagogical approaches have become common in many science curricula. However, while sciences such as physics and chemistry lend themselves to compelling opportunities for interaction (explosions, reactions, objects in motion), certain systems sciences are more challenging for learners to engage with on a short time scale. Applying constructivist, discovery-based methods to the teaching of restoration ecology presents a number of difficulties, including the large amount of time and space over which ecological processes occur, limitations on experiments that can be performed in classroom contexts, and limited access to certain ecological settings. To address these difficulties, a team of computer scientists, ecologists, and educators created the EcoRaft project, a participatory simulation that allows children to learn about restoration ecology by playing the role of ecologists collaborating to restore a virtual rain forest ecosystem. Through qualitative evaluations of the EcoRaft project in multiple contexts, this article explores (1) how to design simulated environments more effectively as a means of promoting collaborative, discovery-based learning of scientific concepts, and (2) how to do so in ways that balance the need for integrating content area knowledge with interactive paradigms that engage young participants.

abstract="This article presents a framework for developing internally sustainable evaluation systems for environmental education organizations, although the framework can be applied to other types of organizations. The authors developed a sustainable evaluation framework (SEF) with the intent of creating an evaluation system that could be self-administered by the staff of an environmental education organization in perpetuity. Key components of the framework include that it is utilization-focused (designed specifically for the needs of its users), participatory (empowering the users at each step of the design and implementation process), theory-driven (employing logic modeling and consulting relevant literature for concept clarification), and consumer-based (directly addressing the needs of probable audiences of evaluation results). The article illustrates the evaluation framework and its key outcomes using a case study from the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont (GSMIT), where the authors facilitated the development of an evaluation system. In addition to the creation of a credible, adaptable, and sustainable system, outcomes of the framework's implementation included clarification of organizational goals, enhanced organizational commitment from staff, professional development, and new prospects for adaptive management.

abstract="Purpose: The rising popularity of social software poses challenges to the design and evaluation of pedagogically sound cross-cultural online collaborative learning environments (OCLEs). In the literature of computer-mediated communications, there exist only a limited number of related empirical studies, indicating that it is still an emergent research area. The purpose of this paper is to describe an OCLE--iCamp Space--which addresses the challenges by integrating three pedagogical concepts--cross-cultural collaboration, self-directed learning (SDL) and social networking--with the aim to advance participants' competencies and by mixed-method approaches to evaluating the complex situations. Design/methodology/approach: A validation field study involving four European countries was conducted. Groups of students co-created a questionnaire, which was assessed to provide an indicator of task performance. Multi-source (surveys, blogs, emails, diaries, chats, videoconference and interviews) and multi-perspective data (facilitators, students and researchers) were studied with social network analysis, content analysis and conversation analysis. Findings: Motivation of learners as well as facilitators is the critical success factor for an OCLE; voluntary involvement is recommended. Participants should be provided with basic training on the use of selected social software tools. Other critical success factors include task selection that contributes to participants' sense of ownership and moderately structured setting that offers some guidance whilst leaving room for the development of SDL competence. Originality/value: The paper enhances a limited, albeit increasing, number of empirical studies deploying social software for educational purposes. It thus contributes to a body of applied knowledge that enables a coherent understanding of this specific research topic to be drawn. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)",

abstract="This diachronic study describes an innovative university experience consisting of the development of multimedia concept maps (MCM) in relation to social educators and social workers main intervention areas and an active discussion in online forums about the results obtained. These MCMs were prepared by students who attended the Information Technologies and Communication course as part of the Degree in Social Education and dual Degree in Social Education and Work during the academic years 2010-13 at Pablo Olavide University (Seville-Spain). Following a methodological framework based on virtual, collaborative action-research, a qualitative analysis is implemented to analyze 213 MCMs created by students and their interventions in ad hoc online discussion forums with a twofold methodological approach: firstly a qualitative analysis of word frequencies in MCM through the use of Atlas-Ti software and secondly a forum discussion categorization through a reticular, category based social network analysis using UCINET and yED Graph Editor. Among the most relevant conclusions, we can highlight that a combination of MCMs and discussion forums are highly interactive and collaborative digital resources and are especially beneficial when applied to social studies. Students were able to identify and categorize key areas of social and educational intervention, including: seniors, children, teens and drug dependence, people with disabilities, adults, mental health, socio-community care, and immigrants.",

abstract="The information explosion characteristic of a knowledge-based economy is fuelled by rapid technological changes. As technology continues to permeate our lives, there will be fresh demands upon the conduct of learning and teaching to ensure that learners are equipped with new economy skills and dispositions for creating significant and relevant meaning out of the large chunks of transmitted data. In the spirit of building learning organisations, this paper proposes that a two-pronged strategy of promoting self-organised learning (SoL) amongst educators and students be adopted. As an enabling framework based on social constructivism, the model of SoL, originally developed by Harri-Augstein {\&} Thomas, is described and applied to an educational setting. For educators engaged in action research, SoL is suited as an approach for managing and reflecting upon change. The use of two such thinking tools, the Personal Learning Contract and the Purpose-Strategy-Outcome-Review (PSOR) reflective learning scaffolds are considered. For students who are now expected to learn independently in situations requiring problem-solving skills, much akin to real life contexts, this article also considers the application of Learning Plans as a conversational tool for personal project management. The authors conclude that SoL promotes skilful critical thinking through a systems thinking process of continuous reflective learning. It is proposed that these are essential qualities for citizens working in a technological age. Case study samples of the thinking tools used in this action research project are included as appendices and evaluated in this article.",

abstract="The growth of distance education has necessitated strong evidence of quality for institutions of higher education, and numerous standards and principles of quality have been developed, such as Quality Matters{\texttrademark} (Quality Matters). These systems are often considered only at the course level to guide design and improve student outcomes, but they can also help to pull the institution together and galvanize advancement in online development. Adopting online quality standards can be a complex process that requires changes to institutional culture. This article describes how the use of the Community of Practice (CoP) framework engaged a campus-wide network of individuals in adoption of the Quality Matters training, rubric, and review process to advance distance education support and online course development. Using Social Network Analysis, researchers were able to identify the strengths and weakness of the CoP during the early adoption phase of Quality Matters to quantitatively measure the connections among members of the community. Based on a survey administered to every participant who attended the Applying the Quality Matters Rubric{\texttrademark} (APPQMR) workshop, researchers analyzed connections across the Quality Matters{\texttrademark} (Quality Matters) Community of Practice (CoP). This analysis indicated strong cohesion of the network based on work related to distance education but low density for connections based on Quality Matters. Furthermore, it demonstrated that significant connections existed between members prior to the adoption of Quality Matters and identified key influencers within the network. The results also indicated that the Quality Matters leadership team at the institution is highly central to the Quality Matters CoP network. The results can be used to identify strategies to further adoption of Quality Matters at the institution by strengthening the CoP.",

The fourth stage trialled the extension of the model to a comprehensive state-wide systems approach involving representatives from all eight Queensland teacher education institutions and other key policy agencies and professional associations. Support for trialling the model included regular meetings among the participating representatives and an implementation guide. This article describes the first three stages of developing and trialling the model before presenting the case study and action research methods employed, four key lessons learned from the project, and the implications of the major outcomes for teacher education policies and practices. The Queensland-wide, multi-site case study revealed processes and strategies that can enable institutional change agents to engage productively in building capacity for embedding EfS at the individual, institutional, and state levels in preservice teacher education. Collectively, the project components provide a system-wide framework that offers strategies, examples, insights, and resources that can serve as a model for other states and/or territories wishing to implement EfS in a systematic and coherent fashion.

abstract="This paper considers the impact of a small-scale action research project which focused on the development of an emergent approach to curriculum making in a general certificate in secondary education course in geography. In this context, we argue that complexity thinking offers a useful theoretical foundation from which to understand the nature of dynamic pedagogic change resulting from the application of action research methods. Results show that process-focused curriculum change can bring about shifts in both learning and assessment. This is seen as being the result of an emergence orientated approach to action research as a counter to more reductionist approaches which are often used and advocated in educational settings by teachers. We conclude that a combination of complexity thinking and action research can offer a valuable medium through which the educational needs of learners and teachers can be addressed in different, localized contexts.",

abstract="The ineffectiveness of community-based interventions can often be traced to problems that occur during implementation. In this study, we outline the implementation of a human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevention program in an educational setting in South Africa. An action research approach was used in the implementation of the intervention and a process and outcome evaluation, integrating qualitative and quantitative research methods, was made. The research illustrated the various levels of interaction in the community and the complexity of the processes involved in the implementation of interventions to facilitate community change. Social ecological theory, systems theory, and the social constructional approach are used to clarify the complexities of the implementation of community interventions.

abstract="Social media practices are increasingly woven into the everyday lives of teens and adults, becoming a significant part of how they relate, know, and learn. In this article, I present findings from a design-based research study that explored how the dynamics of learning and teaching art shift through social media. Learning and teaching through social media has been described as a form of participatory culture, and I expand this further by drawing upon complexity thinking to better understand the reciprocal dynamics of learning and teaching. Learning art through social media can be characterized as encounters with difference, both in ideas and contexts. Subsequently, the dynamics of attention shifts and distributes across collectives. From this, I infer a conceptualization of the art teacher as an identity that is not fixed but one that shifts throughout social media. (Contains 5 figures and 5 endnotes.)",

This qualitative multi-interview study explored the processes that five experienced school psychologist used to solve problems in their practice in the schools. The interviews described their problem-solving efforts as being imbedded in complex school contexts and reliant on a dynamic team process of searching for solutions. The paper suggests that these teams fit what the field of complexity theory calls complex adaptive systems (CAS) and outlines what the research on such systems tells us about enhancing their function. It concludes with suggestions that training programs include these concepts in their consultation training and ensure that all students experience case work that is ongoing and supervised.",

abstract="This paper describes the application of a mixed-evaluation method, published elsewhere, to three different learning scenarios. The method defines how to combine social network analysis with qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to study participatory aspects of learning in CSCL contexts. The three case studies include a course-long, blended learning experience evaluated as the course develops; a course-long, distance learning experience evaluated at the end of the course; and a synchronous experience of a few hours duration. These scenarios show that the analysis techniques and data collection and processing tools are flexible enough to be applied in different conditions. In particular, SAMSA, a tool that processes interaction data to allow social network analysis, is useful with different types of interactions (indirect asynchronous or direct synchronous interactions) and different data representations. Furthermore, the predefined types of social networks and indexes selected are shown to be appropriate for measuring structural aspects of interaction in these CSCL scenarios. These elements are usable and their results comprehensible by education practitioners. Finally, the experiments show that the mixed-evaluation method and its computational tools allow researchers to efficiently achieve a deeper and more reliable evaluation through complementarity and the triangulation of different data sources. The three experiments described show the particular benefits of each of the data sources and analysis techniques.",

abstract="The most pressing social problems facing humanity in the 21st century are what systems theorist Russell Ackoff referred to as ``messes''--complex dynamic systems of problems that interact and reinforce each other over time. In this article, the authors argue that the lack of progress in managing messes is in part due to the predominance of a university-driven isolated-impact approach to social problem solving. The authors suggest an alternative approach called systemic engagement (SE), which involves universities as partners in systemic approaches to community change. The six principles of SE are presented and illustrated with a case example. Barriers to SE are discussed, and strategies are proposed for increasing faculty use of this methodology. The promises and perils of SE as an alternative community-engaged approach to social problem solving are considered.",

abstract="Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe how, from 2004-2006, a New Zealand research team experimented with the ``change laboratory'' learning process to create a new method of government policy development and implementation, referred to as ``practice-making''. The apple industry in Hawke's Bay was chosen because of the level of tension among government agencies and small/medium-sized firms in the industry, particularly around the scarcity of seasonal labour, amid growing concerns about the possible collapse of the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The team stimulated a cycle of expansive learning among the network of activity systems in the industry. Laboratory participants were growers, labour contractors, pack house operators, quality controllers, horticultural consultants and government officials. The expansive learning cycle is a core concept in developmental work research (DWR) and cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). Findings: Participants created a shared ``object'' for apple production and its government policy and regulation built around quality, making a substantive shift from adaptive learning to transformational learning, and creating a major redesign of the industry. Many of the new practices are now being implemented in the industry and government. Practical implications: The CHAT/DWR approach seems particularly well suited for complex problem solving in any network where there are intractable systems contradictions and a strong desire among participants to make real change. Originality/value: It is understood that this is the first time a change laboratory process has been used for government ``practice-making'' with industry, in contrast with traditional policy development and implementation that frequently does not address systemic problems.

abstract="Shape Up Under 5 (SUU5) was a two-year early childhood obesity prevention pilot study in Somerville, Massachusetts (2015--2017) designed to test a novel conceptual framework called Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. For whole-of-community interventions, this framework posits that diffusion of stakeholders' knowledge about and engagement with childhood obesity prevention efforts through their social networks will improve the implementation of health-promoting policy and practice changes intended to reduce obesity risk. SUU5 used systems science methods (agent-based modeling, group model building, social network analysis) to design, facilitate, and evaluate the work of 16 multisector stakeholders (`the Committee'). In this paper, we describe the design and methods of SUU5 using the conceptual framework: the approach to data collection, and methods and rationale for study inputs, activities and evaluation, which together may further our understanding of the hypothesized processes within Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. We also present a generalizable conceptual framework for addressing childhood obesity and similar complex public health issues through whole-of-community interventions.

abstract="On the outer coast of Washington state, traditional lifestyles are closely entwined with the marine resources affected by ocean change, e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification, fishing, coastal development, etc. Our research explores how ongoing ocean change may challenge the social-ecological system surrounding the Quinault Indian Nation's razor clam (Siliqua patula) harvest. We conducted semistructured interviews with Quinault tribal members, scientists, and resource managers to build a conceptual model of the social-ecological system, which we use to (1) understand the emergent effects of changes in availability of razor clams and (2) explore how the tribal community might prepare for or adapt to these changes. Razor clams are a staple food and key source of income for the Quinault people because of their lasting abundance, low cost to harvest, and long season of availability relative to other natural resources. Lower income families experience disproportionate economic impacts during razor clam harvest closures, but less tangible social and cultural impacts are felt broadly throughout the community. Although razor clams have been, in general, available and safe for harvest in recent years, the Quinault people perceive many threats to the resource, including climate change, harmful algal blooms, pollution, and habitat loss. We used the perceived risks identified from the interview results, along with peer-reviewed scientific literature, to develop several ocean change scenarios. Using a stage-based population model of the Pacific razor clam, we explored the relative impacts of these scenarios on annual razor clam harvest over a 20-year period. The simulation of scenarios was developed into a user-friendly web-based application as a planning tool for the Quinault Indian Nation, to help them explore connections between ocean change and razor clam availability, and to support their efforts to plan for and adapt to the impacts of change.

abstract="The primary objective of this paper is to examine how socio-ecological modeling efforts can use participatory visual methods to bridge cultural and linguistic differences among research participants and researchers. The growing number of case studies of indigenous communities highlights the need for methods that recognize and represent such communities' distinctive realities while also establishing alternative communication techniques to enhance the participatory process. Using the Rich Picture method as a first step in a participatory modeling effort in the Tumucumaque Complex, a multicultural indigenous reserve in the Brazilian Amazon, our research specifically investigates how young adults envision the ``good life'' in Tumucumaque, including their perceptions of the elements most central to indigenous lifeways as well as the perceived roles of traditional cultural materials and modern industrial technologies. Finally, we make a critical assessment of the Rich Picture method, elucidating both its strengths and weaknesses while also addressing the, often underestimated, complexity of modeling culture in socio-ecological research.

abstract="This study evaluates the process and preliminary outcomes of Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES), an intervention that brings key stakeholders together so they can discuss suicide prevention research and find ways to put it into practice. Originally piloted in remote and rural Alaskan communities, the approach shows promise. Using a multi-method design, the study describes a series of locally-facilitated ``learning circles'' over 15 months and their preliminary results. Sign-in sheets documented participation. Transcriptions of audio-recorded sessions captured facilitator fidelity, accuracy, and the dominant themes of community discussions. Linked participant surveys (n=83) compared attendees' perceived knowledge, skills, attitudes, and their 'community of practice' at baseline and follow-up. A cross-sectional design compared 112 participants' with 335 non-participants' scores on knowledge and prevention behaviors, and considered the social impact with social network analyses. Demonstrating feasibility in small rural communities, local PC CARES facilitators hosted 59 two to three hour learning circles with 535 participants (376 unique). Local facilitators achieved acceptable fidelity to the model (80{\%}), and interpreted the research accurately 81{\%} of the time. Discussions reflected participants' understanding of the research content and its use in their lives. Participants showed positive changes in perceived knowledge, skills, and attitudes and strengthened their 'community of practice' from baseline to follow-up. Social network analyses indicate PC CARES had social impact, sustaining and enhancing prevention activities of non-participants who were 'close to' participants. These close associates were more likely take preventive actions than other non-participants after the intervention. PC CARES offers a practical, scalable method for community-based translation of research evidence into selfdetermined, culturally-responsive suicide prevention practice. {\textbullet} PC CARES aims to translate research to local suicide prevention practice. {\textbullet} The pilot shows feasibility, community, and cultural acceptability in rural Alaska. {\textbullet} Linked pre-follow-up surveys show participant learning and behavioral outcomes. {\textbullet} At follow-up, participants did more prevention behaviors than non-participants. {\textbullet} Social network analysis suggests positive social impact of PC CARES.

abstract="This paper explores the relevance of the action research for design of technological solutions that lead to both systemic sustainable development and active involvement of the community. The paper shows how this idea was implemented in a project for water resource conservation with educational institutions of rural areas in Colombia. Through the use of technology, a reduction in water consumption increases in awareness about the use of this natural resource, and the active involvement of the community were sought. Additionally, social processes related to the conservation of natural resources were addressed through a socio-technical approach for analysis and design. During the application of the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), the participants and researchers created technological prototypes that allowed to: 1) give visibility to the community's initiatives, and 2) save water in the households. This paper focuses on the importance of the design process of innovative solutions for social and environmental issues through the participative approach of action research.

abstract="Continuums of Care (CoCs) are the primary coordinating bodies for homeless services in the United States. However, the complexities involved in delivering homeless services across interagency networks challenges coordination and system improvement. CoC governance, planning, and service provision have received little attention in academic literature, and thus, Continuums attempt to manage complex systems with little guidance. This evaluation applied community-based system dynamics with homeless consumers and service providers to (1) identify capability traps that impede services delivery and to (2) engage stakeholders in a structured system improvement process. Results revealed organizational structures for governance and planning that inhibit system outcomes. Insights led to policy and practice recommendations for the homeless system.

abstract="In the theory of urban development, the evolutionary perspective is becoming dominant. Cities are understood as complex systems shaped by bottom-up processes with outcomes that are hard to foresee and plan for. This perspective is strengthened by the current turn towards smart cities and the intensive use of digital technologies to optimize urban ecosystems. This paper extends the evolutionary thinking and emerging dynamics of cities to smart city planning. It is based on recent efforts for a smart city strategy in Thessaloniki that enhances the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the city. Taking advantage of opportunities offered by the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, the Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities, the World Bank, and the EU Horizon 2020 Program, Thessaloniki shaped a strategy for an inclusive economy, resilient infrastructure, participatory governance, and open data. This process, however, does not have the usual features of planning. It reveals the complex dimension of smart city planning as a synthesis of technologies, user engagement, and windows of opportunity, which are fuzzy at the start of the planning process. The evolutionary features of cities, which until now were ascribed to the working of markets, are now shaping the institutional aspects of planning for smart cities.

abstract="Solutions that effectively promote sustainable development in urban environments require an understanding of the complexity of human-environment interactions. This paper adopted a systems-based framework to understanding how social, organisational, and environmental factors interact within an urban system in China. Drawing upon a case study from the industrial city of Jinchang, it applied a qualitative bottom-up approach to understand these key factors operating from three perspectives: the commitment of stakeholders, institutional development and personal development of social systems. It revealed that decision-making mechanisms play a key role in improving the sustainability of governance, and that public-private cooperation and public participation are critical for innovative knowledge-based strategies. The key for improving institutional development is to reform the evaluation system of governance thus enhancing the capacities of decision and policy makers, and consequently improve the process of decision-making. Cultural and personal development are important soft power components that influence individual pro-environmental behaviour and performance toward sustainability. The results demonstrated how, in a Chinese context, the urban social system can be understood and urban sustainability can be promoted through environmental adaptation supported by joint efforts from governments, businesses, society and individuals. In this, China does not differ from other nations in spite of significant differences in cultural and political systems. This study contributed to a better understanding of complex urban systems, providing a bottom-up approach and knowledge for enhancing the adaptive capacity toward urban sustainability. Highlights {\textbullet} Adaptive capacity driven by urban social system is essential for sustainability. {\textbullet} A bottom-up approach is effective to understand urban social system. {\textbullet} Multi-stakeholders cooperation benefits innovative knowledge-based strategies. {\textbullet} Reforming evaluation system of governance is critical for governance development. {\textbullet} Cultural and personal development are soft power for individual initiatives.

abstract="The prevalence of obesity among African Americans is higher than among other racial/ethnic groups. African American churches hold a central role in promoting health in the community; yet, church-based interventions have had limited impact on obesity. While recent studies have described the influence of social networks on health behaviors, obesity interventions informed by social network analysis have been limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 281 African American men and women from three churches in northeast urban cities in the USA. Data were collected on sociodemographic and clinical factors and anthropometrics. Using a social network survey applying a name generator, we computed network level metrics. Exponential random graph models (ERGM) were performed to examine whether each structural property found in the empirical (observed) networks occurred more frequently than expected by chance by comparing the empirical networks to the randomly simulated networks. Overall, church friendship networks were sparse (low density). We also found that while friendship ties were more reciprocated between dyads in church networks, and there were more tendencies for clustering of friendships (significant positive transitive closure) than in random networks, other characteristics such as expansiveness (number of actors with a great number of friends) did not differ from what would be expected by chance in random networks. These data suggest that interventions with African American churches should not assume a unitary network through which a single intervention should be used.

abstract="The social-ecological system framework (SESF) can be useful for applied research and management practice beyond its traditional academic applications. In this article we transform the SESF into an image-based practical tool to facilitate knowledge exchange and deliberation processes within community-based natural resource comanagement settings. We develop a transdisciplinary methodology to transform the SESF into simple and context relevant images that are understandable by nonspecialists, yet the imagebased framework still conveys its core tenets of systems thinking, a checklist for system complexity and conceptualizing social-ecological interactions. We then demonstrate a mixed-method approach for testing the usefulness of the image-based framework for enhancing communication, knowledge exchange, and deliberation processes. We show how the academic uses of the SESF, its core tenets, can serve the same purpose for nonacademic actors. When transformed, the image-based SESF has potential to be a tool that can enhance communication and knowledge exchange between actors in governance settings. We demonstrate our methodology with small-scale fishers involved with comanagement in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. In the example, we show how scientists must learn from fishers, to understand how they view their system, in order to make the image-based tool useful in context. We then test its usefulness by exploring the hypothesis that the image-based framework can help fishers discuss with more depth and complexity because it provides a simple conceptual base for systems thinking and a core set of variables to consider as interacting. Furthermore, we explore how using the framework during deliberation may be able to alter the social-psychological outcomes of participants using field experimental methods. We discuss our combined methodology, for transforming the framework and measuring deliberation impacts, while reflecting on new ways of thinking about how the SESF can be useful for applied research and practice.

abstract="The One Health movement aims to provide integrated responses to problems that emerge at the intersections of human, animal, and ecological health. However, it risks derailment due to over-reliance on top-down global responses and generalisations that often fail to fit real-world settings. In this article, we examine the case of parasitic Opisthorchis felineus infection in Western Siberia and argue that understanding the local social dynamics of disease exposure and transmission, and how people live their lives in interactions with other species is crucial for making One Health work in practice. This qualitative study was conducted in preparation for developing an opisthorchiasis control programme and involved 20 in-depth interviews, participant observation, and multiple unstructured interviews in the village of Melnikovo. We explored the social dynamics of O. felineus transmission and designed a participatory model of these dynamics. This model attests to the specificity of transmission dynamics in Western Siberia and demonstrates the importance of understanding this public health issue as embedded in social networks and animated by a variety of locally-specific linkages between ways of life, food and health cultures, health-care systems, economies, and landscapes. Our work highlights that such participatory approaches have to be an integral part of One Health interventions if these interventions are to be effective and legitimate.

abstract="Ecosystem-based management (EBM) represents a comprehensive approach to better govern the environment that also illustrates the collaborative trend in policy and public administration. The need for stakeholder involvement and collaboration is strongly articulated, yet how and for what purposes collaboration would be effective remains largely untested. We address this gap by developing and evaluating a set of hypotheses specifying how certain patterns of collaborations among actors affect their joint ability to accomplish EBM. Content analyses of management plans drawn from five EBM planning processes in Sweden are combined with analyses of the collaborative networks through which these plans have been developed. Our results indicate that system thinking and the ability to integrate across different management phases are favored by collaborations between different kinds of actors, and by project leaders being centrally located in the networks. We also find that dense substructures of collaboration increase the level of specificity in the plans in regards to explicating constraints on human activities. Having many collaborative ties does however not enhance the overall level of specificity. Our results also show that different network characteristics can give rise to similar EBM outcomes. This observed equifinality suggests there is no single blueprint for well-performing collaborative networks.

abstract="Local government (LG) is increasingly playing a role in tackling environmental issues and promoting sustainability. An important element of this LG focus is sustainability education and engagement, yet only few details on the nature of these activities are evident. Similarly there is little understanding of the professional competencies required by LG staff to deliver the relevant sustainability education and engagement activities. A web-based survey of LG sustainability officers in the State of Victoria (Australia) provides insight into the focus of these officers' work and the competencies they rely on. The findings seek to guide the training and employment of LG sustainability staff and the effective delivery of sustainability education and engagement activities. Broadly, the sustainability officers surveyed are closely involved with activities within their LG organisation, but are engaging less so with specific education institutions, organisational sectors and the community in general. In keeping with this, the major sustainability education and engagement focuses are collaboration with peers and stakeholders, rather than community-wide initiatives. For undertaking sustainability education and engagement activities, systems-thinking, anticipatory competence and normative competence were highlighted as important; however, strategic competence and interpersonal competence were considered most important.

abstract="The complexity of local situations in which agricultural value chains are enacted requires a systemic understanding when seeking to improve interlinked livelihoods. Studying the fresh pineapple value chain in Uganda offers an illustrative example. Individually negotiated and context-specific actor relationships, along with their connected activities can be revealed by conceptualizing the chain as a purposeful human activity system. We followed a systems learning approach to elicit value chain actors' perspectives on factors influencing their activities while surfacing relevant problem situations, resolutions and constraints. Participatory methods, including cognitive mapping, were used to spark dialogue during meetings with only farmers, traders and brokers and also with mixed groups. The results present the multiple natural, technical and social factors identified by value chain actors leading to losses and benefits to their income. System driving and shaping influences included infrastructure, seasonality, perishability and weather conditions. Process-oriented analysis of multi-stakeholder discussions revealed feedback cycles related to fragmentation of the chain. This resulted from and contributed to problematic communication, price fluctuations and challenges in actor relations. For example, actors proposed uniform pricing and debated the implications. Although the systemic perspective brought forward actors' awareness of potential benefits of improved collaboration and recognition of interdependent activities, it also exposed barriers. Participatory systems learning helped to capture actors' room of maneuver, and can support processes towards actor-driven change.

abstract="Industrial sectors that operate in uncertain environments - with demand variability, product seasonality and different industrialisation structures - need studies that enable identification and forecast trends. Therefore, the development of competitiveness extends beyond a company's individual performance. Collective action, whether toward consumer markets, supplier markets, competitors and substitutes, can reinforce or help reformulate the current practices of an organisation, besides providing better results in the development of strategies and competitive positioning. Thus, clothing, the sector addressed in this work, is characterised by a long, fragmented, heterogeneous production chain, the competitiveness of which is linked to product differentiation. Therefore, the use of systemic approaches to study this sector is effective. In this sense, this research aims at adapting Systems Thinking and Scenario Planning (STSP) so that it supports the development and planning process in a given sector. Thus, this research applies STSP adapted to an analysis of the clothing sector in the northern region of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. As a result, in academic terms, this research proposed and validated a method for analysing industrial sectors of the clothing industry. In the sectoral context, this research identified elements that leverage the sector's competitiveness, besides generating knowledge and learning aimed at strengthening the sectoral structure identified, and fostering the formation of a new clothing cluster.

abstract="Community-based management practices stakeholder inclusivity is claimed to be the panacea in overcoming problems and dilemmas in governing ecotourism. Kampung Kuantan Fireflies Park (KKFP) in Kuala Selangor faced several complaints from tourists which were hypothesised to be associated with governance of the park. Social network analysis was utilised to identify the key stakeholders within the governance network of managing ecotourism and in understanding the interests and roles of these stakeholders. The network metrics used were number of edges, density, geodesic distance, and degree and betweenness centralities. The network metric and map obtained suggested that the local community boatmen had the highest degree and betweenness centralities in the KKFP social network. Inclusivity, particularly in the fireflies observation boat ride and tour services, had occurred but involvement in the management decision-making held by the district office could be improved. Possible explanations are provided for the dichotomy of findings between the informal power held by the local community boatmen and the formal authority held by the district office in the context of the Malaysian culture and custom.

abstract="The study of social-ecological systems (SES) is an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor that necessitates collaboration among multiple researchers and stakeholders. These collaborations often result in novel insights into the dynamics and feedbacks that occur within these systems. Achieving these insights requires methods and tools that integrate diverse knowledge from multiple disciplines and sectors of society to inform actionable research on complex systems. Past research has demonstrated the contributions that stakeholders can make to defining scenarios that are subsequently applied to quantitative modeling. Here, we focus on the feedback from quantitative modeling to refinement and interpretation of scenarios, and demonstrate how quantitative modeling can reveal aspects of system dynamics that were not considered during scenario development. We present a case study in which we use qualitative scenario planning as a tool to engender systems thinking by a diverse set of stakeholders in a complex transboundary SES: the Mongolian Plateau. This exercise demonstrated the value of participatory scenario planning as a tool for facilitating interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral dialog and knowledge generation. It also ensured the integration of place-based knowledge into scenario development for subsequent quantitative modeling. In addition to incorporating stakeholder knowledge in simulation of complex human-environment dynamics, the quantitative modeling revealed how the dynamics of rural out-migration contribute to the decoupling of rural herder populations and livestock numbers. The emergent knowledge gained from this process underscores the utility of pairing the qualitative scenarios with quantitative simulations to reveal unanticipated system behavior and key drivers not identified or overlooked by stakeholders.

abstract="While in many cases the benefits of ecosystem services (ES) can be enjoyed on different scales, the provision of ES requires engagement and commitment at the local scale. Therefore, the local level becomes important when thinking about compensation schemes or payments for ecosystem services (PES) as an approach to managing ES. The difficult task of bringing together different actors and institutions at different scales for specific conservation projects at the local level often remains in the hands of intermediaries. In this paper, we investigate the role of a civil society organisation (CSO) as an intermediary organisation in a PES scheme, the Community Blue Carbon Project (CBCP) in Costa Rica. To assess the role of intermediaries in a PES scheme, we rely on social network analysis and examine the position and role of the intermediary organisation. Based on Net-Map interviews, which is an interview-based mapping tool that helps people understand, visualise, discuss and improve situations in which many different actors influence outcomes, we find that the intermediary organisation in the CBCP is composed of several institutional and individual intermediaries who create both formal networks for connecting the international to the local level and informal networks for creating trusting relationships among the actors. Different spatial levels are reflected within the CSO's organisational structure, and the CSO mitigates the distributional, procedural, recognition and contextual aspects of environmental justice.

The purpose of this study was to describe Latina/o migrant workers' perceptions regarding the individual, communal, and contextual factors that influence their well-being. A community-based qualitative approach was taken to describe perceptions of well-being in the Latina/o migrant worker population. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 12 South Florida Latina/o migrant workers using a semi-structured interview guided by the Developmental Systems Theory and Prilleltensky's conceptualization of well-being. Conventional content analysis identified five themes: children as a point of connection, a mosaic of informal support, navigating a multi-stressed life context, awareness of lack of agency, and toward the promotion of well-being. This study is one of the first explorations of well-being in Latina/o migrant workers and includes recommendations for providers, researchers, and advocates.

abstract="Infrastructure modernization is a central concern in many cities of the developing world. Local governments struggle to provide adequate public services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic inequalities. After the demise of the centralized modernist planning paradigm, current approaches to urban development focus on public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that involve multiple stakeholders and complex relationships of accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision making, but can also lead to new social practices and participatory models of infrastructure governance. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social practices surrounding the provision and modernization of streetlight and electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors. Drawing from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog, 2015 ), we propose a model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of improvisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding infrastructure governance as an improvisational process of ``call and response'' among a diverse set of actors. We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city of Manila and its utility companies, involving smart city technologies including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue that despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these technologies, they constitute improvisational responses to local conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for improvisational infrastructure governance, which are not limited to the Global South, but also apply in developed countries.

abstract="Background: Evidence-based standards for management of the seriously sick child have existed for decades, yet their translation in clinical practice is a challenge. The context and organization of institutions are known determinants of successful translation, however, research using adequate methodologies to explain the dynamic nature of these determinants in the quality-of-care improvement process is rarely performed. Methods: We conducted mixed methods research in a tertiary hospital in a low-income country to explore the uptake of locally adapted paediatric guidelines. The quantitative component was an uncontrolled before and after intervention study that included an exploration of the intervention dose-effect relationship. The qualitative component was an ethnographic research based on the theoretical perspective of participatory action research. Interpretive integration was employed to derive meta-inferences that provided a more complete picture of the overall study results that reflect the complexity and the multifaceted ontology of the phenomenon studied. Results: The improvement in health workers' performance in relation to the intensity of the intervention was not linear and was characterized by improved and occasionally declining performance. Possible root causes of this performance variability included challenges in keeping knowledge and clinical skills updated, inadequate commitment of the staff to continued improvement, limited exposure to positive professional role models, poor teamwork, failure to maintain professional integrity and mal-adaptation to institutional pressures. Conclusion: Implementation of best-practices is a complex process that is largely unpredictable, attributed to the complexity of contextual factors operating predominantly at professional and organizational levels. There is no simple solution to implementation of best-practices. Tackling root causes of inadequate knowledge translation in this tertiary care setting will require long-term planning, with emphasis on promotion of professional ethics and values and establishing an organizational framework that enhances positive aspects of professionalism. This study has significant implications for the quality of training in medical institutions and the development of hospital leadership.

abstract="Impacts from post- Fordist and poststaples economic transition in the Canadian natural resource sector have resulted in dramatic challenges to the livelihoods of many rural residents and the viability of many rural communities. This study seeks to understand community response to economic transition through a lens of social ecological resilience. This article puts forward Archer's theory of cultural morphogenesis as an analogous model of social ecological change that focuses attention on cultural systems, cultural elaboration, and collective action within an adaptive cycle of resilience. With case material from focused ethnographies of two forest-dependent communities, we identify distinctive interactions between culture and agency over time that condition community response to change, and we make an analytical distinction between the social system and cultural system. These insights point to catalysts for collective action and adaptation within a resilient cultural realm that extend beyond institutional factors such as economic dependency or political opportunity. By integrating culture, we also deepen the social theory contribution to social-ecological resilience.

The increasing role of agro-food supply chains enables African countries to enhance their position in global markets and to sustain local development and growth, by encouraging a higher market-orientation in the governance of global value chains. In this paper, an exploratory analysis based on a quest ionnaire involving 319 smallholder farmers in the North of Sierra Leone is conducted in order to explore the role of collective action in driving the potential bottom-up reconfiguration of cashew value chain. A change from captive to relational governance is expected to positively support the local industry upgrading, to reduce transaction costs and information asymmetries, and to increase the local development and growth by enhancing employment creation and poverty alleviation.

abstract="Modern societies are increasingly characterised by complex multilevel governance mechanisms. Nonetheless, evaluations of how development initiatives are implemented with respect to the international aid effectiveness agenda have embraced this multilevel complexity only to a limited extent. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to place the discussion on aid effectiveness within a multilevel governance perspective, going beyond country assessments. Secondly, to evaluate the Paris principles in terms of dynamic processes rather than simply outcomes, thus entailing the need for systemic evaluations, also through participatory methods. The Ethio-Italian cooperation project 'Agricultural Value Chains in Oromia' is analysed as a case study, assessing its coherence with the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness by involving stakeholders at different levels. Overall, the project's focus on transformative quality-oriented value chain processes is proved to substantially shape dynamic multi-stakeholder interactions in enhancing Paris principles at local, national and international levels.

We analyze the inception and progress of several project-based learning-centered academic courses that were aimed at developing the project management skills of graduate and undergraduate students. The experience involved approximately 1800 students from two universities and 40 community partners. The students developed real-life projects on behalf of institutions and non-governmental organizations located in the area that help people in need; we refer to these agencies as `community partners.' We analyze the development of the course from a systemic perspective, making use of causal loop diagrams in order to understand the main driving dynamics. We discuss the results achieved by these projects and the benefits brought to the community partners. We also present testimony from the community partners themselves. We conclude by presenting the lessons we learned over the years we have been running this course.

abstract="The sustainability transformation calls for policies that consider the global consequences of local lifestyles. We used stakeholders' visions of sustainable lifestyles across Europe to build 19 scenarios of sufficiency (net reductions) and 17 of green consumption (shift in consumption patterns). We applied Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output analysis to model scenarios by assuming widespread adoption of the proposed lifestyles changes. Finally, we estimated the domestic and foreign implications for land, water, carbon and human toxicity potential. We distinguish the options with most potential from those that are seemingly fruitless or present backfire risks. While our method allows for testing a large number scenarios under a consistent framework, further work is needed to add robustness to the scenarios. However, we do find a range of indicative results that have strong potential to contribute to mitigation efforts. Services : We find that a local and sharing service economy has a maximum reduction potential of 18{\%} of the European carbon footprint (CF). Clothing {\&} Appliances : Sharing and extending lifetimes of clothes and devices could diminish CF by approximately 3{\%}. Transport : Reducing motorized transport by remote work and active travel could mitigate between 9 and 26{\%} of CF. Food : Vegan diets could spare 4{\%} of the land and reduce up to 14{\%} of CF. Bio-economy : Switching to biomaterials and bioenergy tend to reduce carbon and toxic emissions at the risk of increasing water and land use. Housing : Passive housing and decentralized renewable energy reduces carbon emissions up to 5 and 14{\%}, respectively. We characterize the sensitivity of our results by modelling income rebound effects and confirm the importance of deterring expenditure in resource intensive goods.

However, erratic volumes and quality of milk limit the participation of small- and mediumscale cattle farmers into higher-value dairy value chains. This research uses a system dynamics (SD) approach to analyze the Matigu{\'a}s dairy value chain in Nicaragua. The paper presents the conceptual framework of the model and highlights the dynamic processes in the value chain, with a focus on improving feeding systems to achieve higher milk productivity and increased income for producers.

abstract="Priority populations disproportionately experience tobacco-related disparities, despite population level declines in tobacco use. The Leadership and Advocacy Institute to Advance Minnesota's Parity for Priority Populations (LAAMPP) recruits and trains African immigrants/African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Chicano/Latinos, and LGBTQ community members to develop leaders to address tobacco harms in their communities. This paper describes and evaluates the LAAMPP Institute, and discusses lessons learned through the Institute and future directions for community-based tobacco-control efforts. The mixed-methods evaluation included qualitative key informant interviews with LAAMPP Fellows and community and project contacts, a Skills Assessment Tool, project case studies, and a social network analysis of the Fellows' tobacco-control social networks at baseline and follow-up. At followup, Fellows' tobacco control networks were larger, more extensive and diverse, and included more actors perceived to be influential in tobacco control. Fellows' skills increased in core competencies (tobacco control, advocacy, facilitation, collaboration, cultural/community competence) and Fellows used tobacco, advocacy and cultural/community competencies more frequently. Four of five cohorts successfully passed policies. The results of LAAMPP suggest that a cross-cultural leadership institute contributes to the successful development of capacity and leadership skills among priority populations and may be a useful model for others working toward health equity.

abstract="Local participation of stakeholders in governance of protected areas is considered to be important to natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. Social network analysis (SNA) is a useful tool for analysis because it allows the understanding of stakeholders' relationships, interactions, and influences through communication networks. We combine quantitative and qualitative data to undertake a SNA for the natural park of Sant Lloren{\c{c}} del Munt in Catalonia, Spain. This is aimed at (1) assessing the structure of the communication network; (2) comparing the informal communication network with the formal participatory bodies of the natural park; and (3) selecting participants for subsequent analyses of the adequate governance structure of the natural park. The results suggest that an informal network of communication, which is reasonably well represented in participatory bodies, exists. However, this communication network is not functioning perfectly because stakeholders experience a lack of trust in the governance bodies of the park, which they perceive to be ineffective. Our results show that SNA is an effective tool to support the creation of a broad representation of stakeholders in participatory processes.

abstract="The challenge of managing water resources in England is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain, a situation reflected in many countries around the world. Cooperative and participatory forms of governance are now seen as one way of addressing this challenge. We investigated this assertion by focusing on five farmer irrigator groups in the low-lying east of England. The groups' relationship with water resources management was interpreted through the lens of comanagement, which over the past decade has increasingly merged with the field of adaptive management and related concepts that derive from resilience thinking and complex adaptive systems theory. Working within a critical realist paradigm, our analysis was guided by the politicized institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework. Two previous studies concerned with the broader context surrounding farming and water governance in lowland England revealed low levels of trust between farmers, and between farmers and water managers, as well as a power dynamic that stands in the way of farmer cooperation and participation. Within this context, our findings pointed to a number of mechanisms and structural conditions that appear to generate or facilitate comanagement. Of these, institution building through the specific group strategy of adopting a company structure and the ``stationarity'' of the resource group members extract from were seen to be the most crucial. These and other key findings were used to inform a discussion of farming and water resources management in England going forward. In doing so, we also reflected on the relationship between comanagement and market-based approaches to managing water resources. Beyond this, the research serves as a practical demonstration of how the politicized IAD framework can be used to analyze potential (adaptive) comanagement situations and the related benefits. The analysis complements a previous submission to this journal, in which we discussed the relationship between the framework and (adaptive) comanagement from a theoretical and methodological perspective.

RAP is a change process wherein participants collectively question, reflect, and address challenges facing research and teamwork. We examine RAPs through frameworks of reflective inquiry, systems thinking, social and transformative learning, and participative reflection. We introduce a case study of the Socio-ecological complexity (SEC) project in Mongolia to highlight stakeholder complexity, knowledge integration, and potential tensions in transdisciplinary research. Bridging theory and lessons from the SEC project, we provide stakeholder engagement and accountability indicators for research teams and organizations to reflect and take action. Based on literature and SEC experiences, we provide our lessons learned and principles for facilitating RAPs across transdisciplinary research teams. These principles may facilitate the communication of transdisciplinary research needs, transformative learning, and the development of outreach action plans for bridging science-management gaps.

abstract="This article highlights the results of an action research to upgrade mountain farmers of bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamalaNees and Eberm) in Udayapur district of Nepal. Farmers received low prices, lacked market information, capacities, and institutional mechanisms, and were exploited by traders. To address these constraints, three independent but interlinked pro-poor value chain (VC) upgrading strategies comprising VC coordination upgrading and horizontal and vertical contractualization were implemented. Information was collected from focus-group discussions with collectors, traders, and facilitators, and a questionnaire was used to collect pre- and postintervention data (n = 120). VC upgrading strategies improved harvesting practices, increased farmers' bargaining power, and led to a threefold increase in price, which increased household incomes. Results demonstrated improved terms of participation of farmers and a general increase in market price of bay leaf in Udayapur. The study approach can be up scaled to reduce poverty from high value products.

abstract="In a previous report, the ISPOR Task Force on Dynamic Simulation Modeling Applications in Health Care Delivery Research Emerging Good Practices introduced the fundamentals of dynamic simulation modeling and identified the types of health care delivery problems for which dynamic simulation modeling can be used more effectively than other modeling methods. The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods---system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose---type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object---scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing ``volume, velocity and variety'' and availability of ``big data'' to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation.

abstract="Rangeland-based livestock systems have to deal with the significant instability and uncertainty of the agricultural context (policy changes, volatility of input prices, etc.), and especially of the climatic context. Thus, they are particularly concerned by adaptive management strategies. To support the development of such strategies, we developed a board game including a computer model called ``Rangeland Rummy''. It is to be used by groups of farmers and agricultural consultants in the context of short workshops (about 3 h). Rangeland Rummy builds upon five types of material object: (i) a game board; (ii) a calendar stick indicating the starting date of the game board; (iii) sticks marked with the feed resources available for combinations of vegetation types and their management practices; (iv) cards to define animal groups and their feeding requirements throughout the year; (v) cards related to types of feed that can be attributed to animal groups throughout the year. Using these material objects, farmers collectively design a rangeland-based livestock system. This system is immediately evaluated using a computer model, i.e. a spreadsheet providing graphs and indicators providing information on, among other things, the extent to which quantitative and qualitative animal feeding requirements are covered across the year. Playing the game thus consists in collectively and iteratively designing and evaluating rangeland-based livestock systems, while confronting the players with new contextual challenges (e.g. interannual variability of weather, volatility of input prices) or new farmers' objectives (e.g. being self-sufficient for animal feeding). An example of application of Rangeland Rummy with 3 farmers in southern France is reported. Applications show that it tends to develop farmers' adaptive capacity by stimulating their discussions and the exchange of locally-relevant knowledge on management strategies and practices in rangeland-based livestock systems.

abstract="Natural resource management (NRM) organizations are increasingly looking to resilience thinking to provide insights into how social and environmental systems interact and to identify points of intervention. Drawing on complex systems analysis, resilience thinking emphasizes that landscapes constantly change from social and ecological interactions, and focuses NRM planners' attention on identifying key variables, feedbacks, and thresholds that can help improve intervention strategies. More deliberative approaches are being developed to use resilience thinking in ways that engage and build human capacity for action. This article documents experiences shared with NRM agencies in rural Australia as we developed new approaches to link resilience thinking with collective learning principles. We present an emerging framework through which heuristics associated with resilience thinking is being used as part of a planning-by-doing process. The framework is being tested to assess whether and how it can enable change agents to advance their capacities for adaptation and transformation.

abstract="Introduction: Moving from existing segmented care to integrated care is complex and disruptive. It is complex in the sense that the type of changes and the timeframe of these changes are not completely predictable. It is disruptive in the sense that the process of change modifies but also is influenced by the nature of interactions at the individual and organisational level. As a consequence, building competences to govern the necessary changes towards integrated care should include capacity to adapt to unexpected situations. Therefore, the tacit knowledge of the stakeholders (``knowledge-in-practice developed from direct experience; subconsciously understood and applied''1) should be at the centre. However, the usual research and training practices using such a knowledge (i.e. action research or case studies), are highly time-consuming. New approaches are therefore needed to elicit tacit knowledge. One of them is agent based modelling (ABM)2 through computer simulation. The aim of this paper is to make a ``showcase'' of an agent-based model that uses the emergence of tacit knowledge and enhances loco-regional adaptive governance for improving integrated chronic care. Theory/Methods: We used a complex adaptive system's lens to study the health systems integration process. We applied key components of ABM to assess how health systems adapts through the dynamics of heterogeneous and interconnected agents (agents are characterised by their level of autonomy, heterogeneity, and interactions with other agents). The agentbased model was developed through a process where concept maps, causal loop diagrams, object-oriented unified modelling language diagrams and computer simulation (using Netlogo{\textcopyright}) were iteratively used. Results: The agent-based model was presented to health professionals with variable experience in healthcare to elicit their perceptions and tacit knowledge. It consisted of agents with certain characteristics and transition rules. Agents included providers, patients, networks' or health systems' managers. Agents can adopt or influence the adoption of integrated care through learning and because of being aware, motivated and capable of decision making. The environment includes institutional arrangements (e.g., financing, training, information systems and legislation) and leadership. Different scenarios were created and discussed. Key rules to strengthen adaptive governance were reflected on. Discussion and conclusion: This study is an initial step of an exercise to use ABM as a means to elicit of and enhance tacit knowledge to strengthen governance for integrated care. It is expected that the study will foster dialogue between actors of loco-regional projects to integrate health and social care for chronic diseases in Belgium (a new program initiated by federal authorities).

abstract="Introduction: Predictive risk tools can enhance the planning of integrated services across health / social care and primary / acute by utilising real-time patient data to identify those who might benefit from different interventions and models. But commissioners / those planning services need to envisage the likely impact of interventions on whole populations over time. Data-led approaches enable analysis of the state of a population, but data alone cannot generate projections of what might happen in future under a redesigned system. A better alternative approach is a 'whole systems' based computer simulation. This submission is based on a case study in Stockport, England, in which health and social care commissioners initially jointly developed a new case-finding service using the risk stratification tool (combined PARR, patients at risk of readmission) to contact people at risk. Those contacted were assessed, with a view to increasing their uptake of existing community-based services, in the hope that this might have a preventive effect, especially on reducing acute admissions from this group. Post-implementation, hoped-for reductions in admissions were not realised. To explore why, the joint commissioning group used computer simulation within a 'group model building' context, facilitated by an expert modeller. Theory/Methods: The enquiry was based on System Dynamics, an application of computer simulation particularly suited to understanding, at population level, how 'whole systems' change over time. The approach is most powerfully experienced within the context of 'group model building', where an expert group (in this case, commissioners from health and social care) is facilitated to build a model, populate it with data, and run a series of scenarios exploring system behaviour. The group model building formed part of a consulting assignment. The group met six times at monthly intervals; between meetings the modeller built the model and engaged with group members to elicit data. Results: This enquiry pointed to the importance of understanding dynamics (change over time) not revealed by data-led approaches. The model showed that the intervention was offered to many whose risk-level would have improved anyway, meaning that projected savings from reduced acute admissions were unrealistically high. The model comprised four modules: {\textbullet} Population, the whole registered adult population (45,000) in a district, divided into sixteen 'stocks' (four age bands, with each age band divided into the four risk groups); as the model steps forward in time, the population ages, and people move up and down ('flow') between risk groups {\textbullet} Acute admissions, driven by different rates from each of the sixteen (age by risk) groups {\textbullet} Capacity and dynamics of the new intervention {\textbullet} Financial flows based on spend on acute admissions and the case finding service The main finding was that this case finding approach would be unlikely to generate significant savings. In most scenarios, the cost of the new service would be more than the savings generated by reduced acute admissions. The main reason was that secondary analysis of the risk stratification data revealed that although the number of people in each risk group does not vary much over time, this masks a high rate of underlying churn within the system, as people move both up and down the risk scale. Discussions: The predictive risk literature tends to be 'stock' based and pyramid-shaped (typically, how the population is distributed across groups, for example). It is implicit that these distributions result from a long-term deterioration dynamic similar to the combined effect of multiple long-term conditions. This new analysis of a local database tracking real-time PARR status suggests 'combined PARR' score gives undue weight to recent acute events. But long term deterioration undoubtedly exists. As an experiment, we invented a different set of flow dynamics. This produced the same 'population by dependency' profile as the 'combined PARR' data, but resulting from people moving, slowl , in the direction of greater dependency. This identical prevalence, but different underpinning churn, generated greater savings across the whole system over time. Given that the same distribution of people by risk group might result from different combinations of flow rates (incidence, deterioration, recovery and mortality), forecasting based on extrapolation of trends in stock values alone cannot capture the dynamic, non-linear consequences of interventions that might modify flow rates. Conclusions: A case finding intervention based on this risk stratification tool, in effect, targets many people who would have improved anyway. This does not mean that case finding approaches should be abandoned. Based on a risk stratification tool that actually captures long-term deterioration, they can be effective (in terms of benefit to recipients), maybe even saving money across the whole system. Of course, we do not argue that new approaches to integration are only justifiable if they reduce costs. Lessons learned: This study is one of several that point to commissioners needing to take a dynamic view of prevalence. Before intervening in a population, one needs to understand and model dynamics underpinning observed prevalence (incidence, duration of condition, untreated deterioration / improvement pattern, service effect, mortality). System Dynamics provides a methodology for integrating diverse sources of evidence (about prevalence, service capacity and cost, treatment effects, and expenditure over time). Group model building provides an accessible means for commissioners to collaborate, exploring, and learning about, complex system effects. Limitations: The approach has some resource requirements in the form of the need for expert modellers in a discipline that is not yet widely adopted within public health. It also requires a fresh look at existing datasets, which may not fully capture every relevant phenomenon. But significant insights can be gained relatively quickly. Comparable enquiries, such as demographic microsimulation, might require years of funding to reach similar conclusions. Suggestions for future research: Such approaches can potentially enhance economic evaluations of treatments / services across a whole system. Where a service generates costs and savings across different agencies, differentially over time, an approach that is grounded in complex systems theory merits further exploration.

Among community-based organizations working on education issues there is a growing social media presence, with many groups now using popular social media like Twitter or Facebook to connect with organization members and the public. This article focuses on one youth organization's creation of a social media network using Twitter. The author uses social network analysis to identify the actors who constitute the egocentric Twitter connections of Youth Organizing Today (YOT) and the structural properties of this network. By identifying key actors within social media networks youth organizers will be better prepared to maximize the benefits of social media and enhance their ability to influence education policymaking.

abstract="This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.

Employing Social Network Analysis, we assess how key LEADER features, such as the bottom-up and the participatory approach, are implemented in a new EU Member State. Focusing on the relevance of social networks for LEADER in Romania, we find that the complexity of the programme, weak administrative networks, political influence, and heritage of the socialist era inhibit the smooth introduction of the LEADER instrument. Clearly, founding formal partnerships and better governance remain generally challenging. While bottom-up regional networks can more easily establish social capital, initiatives steered by the communal administration are more competitive in the selection for funding, but tend to neglect participation.

abstract="Comprehensive problem framing that includes different perspectives is essential for holistic understanding of complex problems and as the first step in building models. We involved five stakeholders to frame the management problem of the Central Baltic herring fishery. By using the Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) approach, the views of the stakeholders were built into graphical influence diagrams representing variables and their dependencies. The views of the scientists involved concentrated on biological concerns, whereas the fisher, the manager, and the representative of an environmental nongovernmental organization included markets and fishing industry influences. Management measures were considered to have a relatively small impact on the development of the herring stock; their impact on socioeconomic objectives was greater. Overall, the framings by these stakeholders propose a focus on socioeconomic issues in research and management and explicitly define management objectives, not only in biological but also in social and economic terms. We find the approach an illustrative tool to structure complex issues systematically. Such a tool can be used as a forum for discussion and for decision support that explicitly includes the views of different stakeholder groups. It enables the examination of social and biological factors in one framework and facilitates bridging the gap between social and natural sciences. A benefit of the BBN approach is that the graphical model structures can be transformed into a quantitative form by inserting probabilistic information.

abstract="County and regional government agencies use stakeholder committees to ensure representation of diverse interests when planning, but these representatives often are not trained to understand the complexity inherent to human-environmental issues (e.g., groundwater management). Planning professionals use computer models to simulate the interaction effects of different planrelated policies, but most are ``black boxes'' to stakeholders, who, therefore, are forced to trust the simulations without understanding human-environmental complexity, reducing the opportunities for effective solution building. Agent-based models can represent decisions and environmental dynamics in a rule-based form that invites nonexpert users' involvement in both developing the model and meaningfully interpreting its outputs. We conducted a series of collaborative and developmental agent-based modeling meetings with stakeholders and planners in a rapidly suburbanizing area facing groundwater shortages. Stakeholders learned how to use the models, understand the relationships among the components, interpret the outputs based on these relationships, and suggested modifications with new insights. The enhanced understanding of complex interactions reduced early commitments to policy solutions as stakeholders jointly explored the range of possible outcomes. These results show that agent-based modeling holds promise for use in collaborative planning exercises.

We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 50 key stakeholders in four communities in New York State that experienced collective stakeholder interactions in the contexts of waterfowl hunting or wildlife trapping. Our results revealed that collective action coordinators and brokers, representing local/in-state regional organizations, were not initially involved in the disputes but became involved over time. These individuals reframed the public issue from original concerns over personal safety, private property rights, and spatial proximity to include concerns about humaneness of wildlife harvest activities and regulations. Stakeholder engagement strategies for managing the impacts from these initial interactions should consider the temporal element of how the social construction of each issue changes over time.

In understanding the role of social capital in community development, we do not feel sufficient attention has been paid to the subtle micro-dynamics of civil network structure. Using social network analysis, we explore the link between community cohesion and resilience. Attention is given to conflicting interests that characterize these communities and how they manifest themselves in civic participation and factional affiliations. We find that organizational diversity is a necessary condition for community vitality, but organizations can become captive to factional interests. The critical factors for resilience are associated with a benign side of factions (a plurality of inclusive ties) and the presence of keystone bridging agents. Each offers hidden mechanisms for neutralizing the effects of fragmentation by providing a cohesive capability which remains latent until crises call for collective action.

abstract="Purpose |!|{\#}8211; Foresight often encompasses participative approaches for decision making. This paper aims to give a first overview of the authors|!|{\#}39; research on immediate learning and networking in the context of foresight. The paper seeks to introduce a practical concept for an accompanying social research of a participatory foresight process for empirically identifying and mapping impacts; and to present empirical results from the study of a specific foresight process.Design/methodology/approach |!|{\#}8211; The authors apply three approaches to analyze impacts. Accordingly data were gathered in moderated workshops for process analysis; structured telephone interviews for qualitative analysis; and surveys for social network analysis.Findings |!|{\#}8211; The accompanying social research produced direct insights on experiences and knowledge acquisition of participants in a large, complex foresight process, as well as a measurable increase of personal ties in this process. This research shows that the perception of the wider spectrum of actors in a social system, as well as their rationales and approaches, are one identifiable and crucial achievement of participative foresight processes.Research limitations/implications |!|{\#}8211; This research focuses on immediate learning impacts, while additional impacts of mid- or longer-term scales were not captured in this study. Accompanying social research (e.g. longitudinal studies) of broader scale would be beneficial to foresight research and process design.Originality/value |!|{\#}8211; The authors use a specific foresight process to analyze its immediate impacts. They introduce and demonstrate ways forward to use practical concepts for impact description, empirical data acquisition, and how it relates to underlying process design. The results are relevant for foresight project managers, process counselors and accompanying social research.

abstract="The outcomes of a series of tests of the ARDI (Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions) method in complex cases or conflict-ridden situations is presented. ARDI is part of a companion modeling approach that makes it possible to engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the design and development of land and water management plans. It is based on participatory workshops that set out to collaboratively imagine a future open, dynamic management system, capable of adaptation and anticipation, by gathering the various stakeholders in a partnership to examine conservation of the natural resources and promoting a sustainable development. Its originality lies in the co-construction of a ``conceptual model'' of the functioning of the territory, according to an overarching, negotiated development question. The approach is based on the collective articulation of the key elements of a context or territory by stakeholders such as managers, representatives, socio-professional technicians, nongovernmental organizations, experts, and scientists, and local policy makers. This sharing of representations is done by means of a series of collective workshops during which Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions constituting the profile of the territory are identified and clarified. This work of co-construction is conducted within a precise methodological framework that we present in a step-by-step format. The method is grounded in concrete experience gleened from tests conducted by the authors over the past five years. Finally, the requirement for specific skills as well as pitfalls to avoid when applying the method are discussed.

abstract="Russell L. Ackoff developed the Interactive Planning (IP) methodology as a conceptual tool to guide systematic and systemic development of organizations. One of its unique features is that such development should be ideal-oriented. IP has been well-received within the Systems Thinking community in particular; where more than 300 applications of IP are mentioned. However, it has not been easy to answer the question: ' does the use of IP enable that which it is proposing to enable?' as there have been no systematic, empirically grounded, and critically oriented, evaluations of IP. This study attempts to offer such an evaluation. In this case, IP was employed to support a comprehensive development of a Department within a company. This IP application was evaluated using a set of predefined evaluation criteria derived from the IP as such and also from its critique. The results suggest that IP is indeed a powerful methodology to guide organizational development. While IP has several positive merits, a set of limitations were identified and serve here as a basis for deriving recommendations for the practitioners of IP and also suggestions of areas that merit further IP research.

abstract="Stakeholder participation is becoming increasingly important in water resources management. In participatory processes, stakeholders contribute by putting forward their own perspective, and they benefit by enhancing their understanding of the factors involved in decision making. A diversity of modeling tools can be used to facilitate participatory processes. Bayesian networks are well suited to this task for a variety of reasons, including their ability to structure discussions and visual appeal. This research focuses on developing and testing a set of evaluation criteria for public participation. The advantages and limitations of these criteria are discussed in the light of a specific participatory modeling initiative. Modeling work was conducted in the Upper Guadiana Basin in central Spain, where uncontrolled groundwater extraction is responsible for wetland degradation and conflicts between farmers, water authorities, and environmentalists. Finding adequate solutions to the problem is urgent because the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive requires all aquatic ecosystems to be in a ``good ecological state'' within a relatively short time frame. Stakeholder evaluation highlights the potential of Bayesian networks to support public participation processes.

abstract="The aim of this paper is to highlight the complex networks that support information flows in rural communities of Bolivia by providing a visual representation of the heterogeneous organisational structures that characterise different ethnic groups. The social structures within rural communities provide development agencies with key insights into the support networks created by community-based organisations which can be used to identify strategies to reach marginalised groups. This preliminary analysis of the mechanisms through which the rural poor access new information is particularly important for agricultural development projects which aim to increase producers' awareness of new technologies or provide them with market information. This paper uses social network analysis (SNA) to demonstrate how the bonding ties of affiliation to community-based organisations and the bridging ties of relationships with local institutions demonstrate the different structural properties of rural communities. Development projects which promote local development need to understand these community structures and how they support information flows to marginalised groups.

abstract="Abstract: In this paper we describe a research process on contextual driving factors and decision-making processes used by local actors for land use change in a zone of the Colombian Amazonian frontier. We integrated landscape multi-temporal analysis, Role-Playing Games (RPG), interviews based on flow diagrams and an historical study of landscape dynamics for the construction of our methodological approach. Findings of the study include individual detailed decision-making insights at the farm level that shed light on the mechanisms that boost the advance of the agricultural frontier into the Amazonian forest. We illustrate how individual decisions are related with the general landscape dynamics. A formalization of results was carried out in UML (Unified Modeling Language) for the future construction of a Multi Agent System (MAS) model, the implementation of which will be useful for land use planning, discussions among local and regional actors and scenario building. The RPG constitutes a device that could ``talk'' by itself, in the name of local actors. Facts that hardly would be communicated in an interview emerge implicitly and explicitly through the exercise. The RPG is a device that we call a ``dense methodological tool'', in the sense that it is a designed object that synthesizes a complex system. This is central to territorial planning because RPG and derived MAS models talk to actors and researchers in the same language that human memory and projection mental capabilities function. These objects condense time and space and help make problems clear, and they assist in the finding of solutions and exploration of possible scenarios.

abstract="Technical experts often find they need to include critical information from local residents to address environmental issues. To access this information while simultaneously educating participants, we used a participatory process called mediated modeling. Mediated modeling provides a structured framework for enabling diverse stakeholders to use systems modeling to understand the multidimensional, dynamic, and interactive aspects of environmental problems. We invited scientists, decision makers, and stakeholders from the Salt Lake City area to participate in a series of workshops designed to create a relatively simple model of urban ecosystem processes operating in the Salt Lake Valley, UT. This article describes the mediated modeling process, including four activities used to help participants think systemically about the local airshed and enable them to identify key issues, concerns, and interrelationships between variables affecting emissions. Our analysis indicates that participants gained a greater understanding of complexity and system dynamics related to the urban airshed.

abstract="The sustainable management of renewable resources is often complicated by the diversity and dynamic nature of the ecological and socio-economic systems involved. As the dynamics and interactions of these systems are highly complex and frequently unpredictable, there is a need to opt for transdisciplinary research addressing adaptive and integrated management of renewable resources. Companion modelling (ComMod) is a multi-agent systems (MAS)-based approach relying on synergistic effects between role-playing games (RPG) and agent-based models (ABM) to facilitate collective information sharing and learning, and to improve coordination among stakeholders for negotiation and decision-making. The iterative and adaptive sequences of fieldwork with modelling activities allows the mutual and interactive participation of stakeholders during the design, implementation, calibration and validation steps of the models, as well as exploration of possible scenarios. ComMod was implemented in a study of the conflict between two ethnic communities and a newly proposed national park in Northern Thailand. Deforestation, biodiversity conservation and the livelihoods of the villagers were key issues discussed during RPG sessions with small groups of participants, and subsequently represented in an ABM simulator used with a larger audience. Consequently, the local stakeholders learned about agro-ecological and socio-economic dynamics and gained an increased awareness of these key issues. Mutual understanding was improved, and the importance of collaborative discussion, essential to negotiations and decision-making, became obvious. Finally, this Northern Thailand experience has shown that collaborative interactions mediated by ComMod were supportive of improved communication and joint learning for the adaptive and integrated sustainable management of renewable resources.

abstract="It is vitally important to identify agroecosystems that may cease functioning because of changing climate or land degradation. However, identifying such systems is confounded on both conceptual and methodological grounds, especially in systems that are moving toward thresholds, a common trait of dryland environments. This study explores these challenges by analyzing how a range of external pressures affect the vulnerability of dryland pastoral systems in the Kalahari. This is achieved by employing dynamic systems modeling approaches to understand the pathways by which communities became vulnerable to drought. Specifically, we evaluate how external pressures have changed: (1) different agroecosystems' abilities to tolerate drought, i.e., ecosystem resilience; (2) rural communities' abilities to adapt to drought, mediated via their access to assets; and (3) the ability of institutions and policy interventions to play a role in mediating drought-related crises, i.e., socio-political governance. This is done by reanalyzing ecological and participatory research findings along with farm-scale livestock offtake data from across the Kalahari in Botswana. An iterative process was followed to establish narratives exploring how external drivers led to changes in agroecosystem resilience, access to assets, and the institutional capacity to buffer the system. We use ``causal loop diagrams'' and statistical dynamic system models to express key quantitative relationships and establish future scenarios to help define where uncertainties lie by showing where the system is most sensitive to change. We highlight how that greater sharing of land management knowledge and practices between private and communal land managers can provide 'win-win-win' benefits of reducing system vulnerability, increasing economic income, and building social capital. We use future scenario analyses to identify key areas for future studies of climate change adaptation across the Kalahari.

abstract="Understanding the socio-economic and environmental implications of rural change requires the active participation of many research disciplines and stakeholders. However, it remains unclear how to best integrate participatory and biophysical research to provide information useful to land managers and policy makers. This paper presents findings of a RELU scoping study that has formulated and applied a research framework based on stakeholder participation and adaptive learning to model rural change in the Peak District National Park in the north of England. The paper describes a learning process that integrates different types of knowledge to produce future scenarios that describe possible economic and environmental changes due to a national review of burning practices on heather moorland and blanket bogs. We stress the need for using social network analysis to structure stakeholder engagement and outline how a range of participatory approaches can facilitate more inclusive environmental planning and policy development.

abstract="Current British government policy leans heavily toward a participatory approach to urban development. The alleged benefits range from the growth of trust and social capital to better policy delivery and implementation involving a greater range of actors in the policy process. Yet, in many cases, poorly carried out partnership and participatory efforts can produce outcomes directly opposite to the benefits listed above. The author examines participation as a structural phenomenon and in doing so offers insights into how relationships could be strengthened in order to avoid these negative outcomes. Social network analysis is used to examine the structural relationships found within an urban redevelopment project in Portsmouth, England. Through the application of these measures, a number of relational patterns emerged which were not conducive to participation and left community groups feeling overwhelmed and underrepresented. The author concludes by noting how this technique could be used not only to highlight network imbalances, as seen in the case study, but also to offer community groups proactive advice in developing their network ties and communication structures, thus improving their overall position within the network and helping to deliver better levels of trust and social capital to the process.

abstract="Complex systems are shaped by cross-scale interactions, nonlinear feedbacks, and uncertainty, among other factors. Transdisciplinary approaches that combine participatory and conventional methods and democratize knowledge to enable diverse inputs, including those from local, informal experts, are essential tools in understanding such systems. The metaphor of a `bridge' to overcome the divide between different disciplines and knowledge systems is often used to advocate for more inclusive approaches. However, there is a shortage of information and consensus on the process, methodologies, and techniques that are appropriate to achieve this. This paper compares two case studies from Peru and South Africa in which community-level assessments were conducted as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and explores the different conceptual models used to deal with scale and complexity, the methods adopted to deal with epistemology, and the different means of dealing with uncertainty in each assessment. The paper highlights the conceptual and practical challenges encountered by each assessment and discusses some of the conceptual and practical trade-offs involved in the selection of particular approaches. We argue that a boat navigating between unknown shores may be a more appropriate metaphor than a bridge, whose starting and end points are fixed and known.

abstract="This article presents a specific association of a role-playing game (RPG) and an agent-based model (ABM) aimed at dealing with a large range of time scales. Applications to the field of natural resource management lead one to consider the short time scale of resource use in practice at the same time as the longer ones related to resource dynamics or actors' investments. in their daily practice, stakeholders are translating their long-term strategies, a translation that is contextualized and combined with some co- occurring events. Long-term thinking is required for sustainable use of natural resources, but it should take into account its necessary adaptation on a short time scale. This raises the necessity for tools able to tackle jointly these various time scales. The similarity of architecture between computerized ABMs and RPGs makes them easy to associate in a hybrid tool, targeted at meeting this requirement. The proposition of this article is to allocate the representation of short time scales to computerized ABMs and the long ones to RPGs, while keeping the same static structural conceptual model, shared as a common root by both. This synergy is illustrated with PIEPLUE, an interactive setting tackling water-sharing issues.

abstract="This study used qualitative methods to assess residents' attitudes towards initial tourism development in the small, rural village of Bigodi, Uganda. Due to geographic and political isolation, residents of Bigodi had little or no experience with tourism prior to the 1990s. This changed in 1991 when a tourism development project was initiated there. Although much turbulence followed, tourism was eventually established. In 2003, residents were interviewed about significant events in the village's history, including initial tourism development. Residents uniformly recalled that their attitudes towards initial tourism development were suspicion, anxiety and fear. Residents agreed that it took several years before attitudes began to improve. Analysis shows that residents' attitudes were dependent on events which happened long before the introduction of tourism. This suggests that conceptualising tourism as a complex system is helpful for recognising the multitude of factors which can potentially influence residents' attitudes. Implications for sustainable tourism development are discussed.

abstract="Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants'' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) Duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) Mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, (iii) Configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit. Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e. social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders.

abstract="To assist forest managers in balancing an increasing diversity of resource objectives, we developed a toolkit modeling approach for sustainable forest management (SFM). The approach inserts a meta-modeling strategy into a collaborative modeling framework grounded in adaptive management philosophy that facilitates participation among stakeholders, decision makers, and local domain experts in the meta-model building process. The modeling team works iteratively with each of these groups to define essential questions, identify data resources, and then determine whether available tools can be applied or adapted, or whether new tools can be rapidly created to fit the need. The desired goal of the process is a linked series of domain-specific models (tools) that balances generalized ``top-down'' models (i.e., scientific models developed without input from the local system) with case-specific customized ``bottom-up'' models that are driven primarily by local needs. Information flow between models is organized according to vertical (i.e., between scale) and horizontal (i.e., within scale) dimensions. We illustrate our approach within a 2.1 million hectare forest planning district in central Labrador, a forested landscape where social and ecological values receive a higher priority than economic values. However, the focus of this paper is on the process of how SFM modeling tools and concepts can be rapidly assembled and applied in new locations, balancing efficient transfer of science with adaptation to local needs. We use the Labrador case study to illustrate strengths and challenges uniquely associated with a meta-modeling approach to integrated modeling as it fits within the broader collaborative modeling framework. Principle advantages of the approach include the scientific rigor introduced by peer-reviewed models, combined with the adaptability of meta-modeling. A key challenge is the limited transparency of scientific models to different participatory groups. This challenge can be overcome by frequent and substantive two-way communication among different groups at appropriate times in the model-building process, combined with strong leadership that includes strategic choices when assembling the modeling team. The toolkit approach holds promise for extending beyond case studies, without compromising the bottom-up flow of needs and information, to inform SFM planning using the best available science.

Systems thinking, based on fuzzy concepts, can provide some initial answers to the question of how to improve communication between heterogeneous groups of stakeholders because it demonstrates a greater respect for the knowledge of communities affected by various regeneration initiatives.

abstract="Access to knowledge on farm management practices is essential for the maintenance of productive agroforestry systems. Farmers who lack the means to acquire farming knowledge from formal sources often rely on information within their informal social networks. However, little research has explored the explicit structure of farmer communication patterns. We examined advice network structures by using farmer attributes, i.e., kin relationships, community involvement, and imitation, to characterize structural positions and investigated the consequences of such structure on farming practices in cocoa agroforestry systems in Ghana, West Africa. Furthermore, we used a multicommunity approach; we constructed networks for four communities to increase replication and enhance the generality of our conclusions. A high density of advice ties occurred among a small group of farmers, indicating a core-periphery structure. Settler farmers composed 73{\%} of core position members, suggesting that social proximity did not control the formation of informal advice structures. Because core farmers were highly participative in community activities, the promotion of community involvement may facilitate the movement of knowledge and social exchange to strengthen informal networks. Farmers in both core and peripheral structural positions indicated that they observed fellow farmers and subsequently adopted their practices. Of highly sought farmers, 84{\%} used external information, predominately from government institutions, thus functioning as bridging links between formal and informal networks. Both external and farmer-derived sources of knowledge of agroforestry practices were transferred through informal advice networks, providing available information throughout the farming community, as well as a foundation for community-based adaptive management.

abstract="This paper assesses the performance of poverty alleviation projects, asks why so many have failed, and why successful projects have been successful. It gives a retrospective overview of the development of the concept of poverty, and argues that the way towards poverty eradication goes through holistic, participatory, approaches that build on sharing of knowledge and learning by doing. Projects and programmes should build on the full knowledge of all stakeholders. This way we can create dynamic collaborative environments that build knowledge strategically by developing and applying knowledge as it comes available. It is suggested that approaches should be guided by an enabling framework, within which a multiplicity of partnerships can develop and be effective. Common sense and holistic systems thinking are found to be essential starting points for improvements of the quality of decision-making and the learning and innovation in poverty alleviation efforts.

abstract="The purpose of the 1992 French Water Act is to encourage negotiation and dialogue among local stakeholders within a framework which is very similar to a patrimonial approach. Potential use of models in such post-normal approaches is analyzed. Two kinds of models are compared: one is agent-based, the other follows a more classical approach. They are compared according to their contributions as negotiation support tools. This comparison is based on a specific collective decision process dealing with water allocation at the sub-basin scale, in which authors are involved. Both are used to support collective decision processes through simulation of resource use dynamics. Agent-Based Models entail the broadening of spatial information of actors in the process, revealing inter-connected topics not taken into consideration earlier. This makes it possible to remain relevant, despite the sometimes rapidly evolving stakes. The central point of this paper is the implementation, within a practical application, of theories advocating the use of ABM as a collective decision support system. This application promotes a better understanding of the kind of support ABM provides and the way it does so. This is brought about more by re-framing the discussion and modifying the representation of the system on the part of the stakeholders than by providing specific agreements.

abstract="Those involved in floodplain restoration have to cope with historical conflicts between human and ecosystem needs. The topic is of high importance in Europe due to the European Water Framework Directive that requires restoration and/or maintenance of a `good ecological status of aquatic ecosystems.' However, the seeming trade-off between flood protection and floodplain restoration may change due to a shift in the water management paradigm toward more integrated approaches, in contrast to the command and control approach of the past. This shift in paradigm is summarized in the guiding principle for water management in the Netherlands `Living with floods and give room to water' rather than `Fighting against water.' The paper discusses the role of social learning in the transition toward the adaptive management of floodplains and rivers that is required to restore and maintain multifunctional riverine landscapes. In addition to the uncertainties resulting from our limited knowledge about the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of floodplains, we have to take into account the ambiguities that arise as a result of the different perceptions of stakeholders.

abstract="In the mountain areas of Northern Vietnam, the past decade was marked by rapid changes in agricultural production systems. Under the new land policies, some farmers had no other choice than to return to the traditional slash and burn cropping systems. Now, however, land allocation to individuals prevents farmers from shifting cultivation to newly cleared land, which is necessary to regenerate soil fertility, and thus for slash and burn practices to remain sustainable. As a consequence, in some villages there is an increasing risk of land degradation. As livestock feeding relies mainly on natural resources, land degradation results in chronic shortages of forage and more generally to a crisis in traditional production systems. To tackle these issues, the Mountain Agrarian Systems Program has designed alternative cropping systems based on direct seeding under a cover crop. Beside their widely recognized role in the conservation of soil and natural resources, these innovative techniques also provide good forage for the farm animals. However, their diffusion implies a profound reorganization of the crop-livestock systems at complementary scales from field, farm, and up to the village community. Accompanying such changes requires that all partners jointly develop communication procedures based on a common knowledge base. In this paper we discuss the spatial compartment model, a graphic discussion and simulation tool used to represent a village in a way that allows both researchers and local stakeholders to understand and visualize their individual and collective situations. We used the model to test a set of cropping innovations through a participatory simulation with local farmers. The farmers were very interested in the new techniques, and some began to test them on their own land. The spatial compartment model proved to be an effective communication tool between scientists and local stakeholders.

Three case study sites were identified using matrix sampling and data collected through 29 individual interviews and two focus group interviews, with the interviews augmented with a tool designed to maximize analysis of the processes of developing practice. Findings. The resultant model of developing health care practice includes three processes: using and creating knowledge, understanding and practice of patient care, and effecting development. The whole model was underpinned by professional and organizational learning in which `expert thinkers' engaged in double loop learning to reconceptualize care rather than just perpetuate existing patterns of care delivery.

abstract="We provide new empirical and methodological findings problematising evidence, evaluation and measurement when using asset-based approaches and co-production to improve health and address inequalities. The Assets Model was applied to develop and implement a co-produced methodological evaluation framework--Asset-Based Indicator Framework--measuring impacts of creative community engagement on health and inequalities. Our three-phased approach synthesised data from multiple sources over five years. Phase One identified existing health assets in Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups using a six-month ethnography; interviews with community organisation representatives (n=35); three BME focus groups (n=27). Phase Two identified conditions/actions for assets to be activated to maximise health for `Roma' using community-based participatory action research (n=50). Phase Three turned to evaluation and indicators. The Asset-Based Indicator Framework was co-produced with self-identified Gypsies following an extensive literature review; expert interview; three participatory action-research workshops with professionals (n=20); two participatory action-research workshops with community members and professionals (n=49). Asset-based evaluation and measurement is complex due to narrow conceptualisations of evidence; epistemological and methodological incompatibilities; and lack of capacity and resources for sustained engagement. Understanding the granularity and interrelation of assets at individual, community and structural levels; identifying mechanisms through which change happens; and applying participatory and empowering methods to capture actions on assets leading to community-defined outcomes may not lead to meaningful changes without systemic change. The paper fills a clearly-defined gap addressing evaluation of community engagement within complex systems rather than clinical-medicine interventions with wide-ranging implications for international research, practice and policy.",

abstract="This case study illustrates links between problem structuring, multiple epistemologies across nested scales, assessment, and remediation. Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic disease of people associated with a gastrointestinal tapeworm of dogs. Since it usually cycles between canids and other vertebrates, the parasite is linked to food safety through slaughtering techniques, which in turn are related to changes in the characteristics of the agro-urban ecosystem. These in turn cannot be dealt with without addressing the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of the system, that is, the eco-social narratives which people (including scientists) use to structure their daily lives. A 10-year series of research projects in Nepal demonstrated that post-World War II epidemiological techniques, designed for studying individuals in Western industrialized countries, could identify some risk factors but had a mixed record at achieving solutions which required collective action. Effective solutions were arrived at only after local stakeholders and governance structures were engaged in a process of defining the structure of the problem. Assessment (placing values on scientific measurements) and remediation (acting on those values) require both citizen engagement and an understanding of complex systems. These are synthesized through the creation of culturally acceptable narratives. {\textcopyright} 2005 EcoHealth Journal Consortium.",

abstract="An integrative perspective on assessing land use impacts requires the understanding of relationships between land use and the provision of ecosystem services. This study presents a stakeholder-based modeling approach to assess the potential impact of land use patterns and land use changes on ecosystem services in two districts of northern Ghana. First, the most legitimate group of stakeholders considering their influence and interest in the agricultural sector was selected. Second, ecosystem services and quantitative indicators that are relevant to land uses were determined based on literature and a stakeholder survey. Future land use patterns were simulated considering land use changes caused by urbanization and deforestation in the local context. Subsequently, simulated land use patterns were integrated with the potential values of ecosystem services provided by different land use types to analyze the capacity of ecosystem services provision at district level in a modeling approach. The results showed the current status of ecosystem services supplied by each district, and trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services as effects of the land use changes. The similarity and dissimilarity of land use change impacts between the districts were identified, which were attributed to the different perception by stakeholders and specific characteristics of land use patterns."

abstract="The urban freight logistics policy-making process takes place in a complex environment and presents numerous challenges, such as difficult tradeoffs between the objectives of various stakeholders, unclear problem ownership, and a lack of data on and awareness of urban freight issues. Furthermore, the complex interactions and power dynamics between different stakeholders introduce additional difficulties when attempting to predict the effects of different policies. In this study, we extend the current perspective on urban logistics decision-making by adopting a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) perspective. This allows us to better interpret the behaviors of urban logistics stakeholders and elucidate some of the most pressing challenges encountered in urban logistics policy-making. Building on the extant urban logistics and CAS literature, we establish an integrative decision-making framework that aims at increasing the success of urban logistics policies. Finally, we apply our framework to a case study in order to illustrate the operationalization of the proposed CAS perspective in an empirical setting on urban logistics policy-making."

We describe how change leaders of a grant-funded instructional change initiative developed relational expertise by analyzing faculty relationships and social subgroups to identify who was involved in discussions about teaching and learning and what specific topics were discussed. Results: Faculty discussions focused on daily classroom needs. Faculty who were in different departments or schools were mostly disconnected from each other, and faculty within these units often had subdivisions among them. Conclusions: Faculty lacked opportunities to discuss education, specifically, systems-level perspectives. The change leaders created organizational structures to catalyze communities, including an action research fellowship program, to support faculty in education discussions.",

number="10",
abstract="Food security in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is dependent on complex networks of interconnected actors and the flows of resources (biomass, capital) and information among them. However, the degree to which actors and value chains of different crops are in fact interconnected and their current systemic influence on food security are unclear. Therefore, the concept of value webs to better capture the complexity within the networks emerges. Biomass-based value webs of selected crops in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ethiopia are modeled using the systems analysis software iMODELER and by eliciting factors as well as their interconnections through participatory stakeholder workshops. Furthermore, a generic model was created compiling the country models to identify overarching system dynamics with supporting and hindering factors impacting food security in SSA. Findings from the country models show highly complex value webs, suggesting that the predominant value chain approach may oversimplify actual structures and resource flows in real life settings. However, few interconnections within the value webs link the actors and flows of different crops, contradicting predictions emerging from other research. Results from the generic model allow for a critical reflection on the relation between value web dynamics and food security policy in SSA. Current national and regional policy trends targeting market integration, mechanization, and reduction of post-harvest losses are supported by model results.",

journal="Frontiers in Environmental Science",
year="Apr",
volume="7",
abstract="As the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus becomes an increasingly common framework for bridging science and policy, there is a growing need to unpack and make explicit many of the methods and assumptions being used to operationalize the nexus. In this paper, we focus on two common approaches to nexus research, quantitative modeling and futures thinking, and the ways that each set of methodological tools address uncertainty. We first review the underlying assumptions of each approach with a focus on sources of and ability to measure uncertainty, and potential complementarities. Quantitative modeling takes a probabilistic approach to predicting the likelihood of a specific outcome or future state based on estimates of current system dynamics. In contrast, futures thinking approaches, such as scenario processes, explore novel changes that cannot be fully predicted or even anticipated based on current understandings of the nexus. We then examine a set of applied nexus projects that bridge science and policy-making contexts to better understand practitioner experiences with different methodological tools and how they are utilized to navigate uncertainty. We explore one nexus case study, LIVES Cambodia, in-depth, to better understand the opportunities and challenges associated with participatory modeling and stakeholder engagement with uncertainty in a policy-making context. Across the cases, practitioners identify the complementarity between modeling and futures thinking approaches, and those projects that integrated both into the planning process experienced benefits from having multiple angles on uncertainty within the nexus. In particular, stakeholder engagement provided critical opportunities to address some types of uncertainties (e.g., data gaps) through the use of local knowledge. Explicit discussions of model uncertainty and use of scenario processes also enabled stakeholders to deepen their understandings of uncertainties and envision policy pathways that would be robust to uncertainty. In many senses, models became boundary objects that encouraged critical thinking and questioning of assumptions across diverse stakeholders. And, for some nexus projects, confronting uncertainty in explicit and transparent ways build capacity for policy flexibility and adaptiveness. We conclude with a discussion of when and how these benefits can be fully realized through the strategic use of appropriate approaches to characterizing and navigating nexus uncertainty.",

abstract="Around the world there are more than 100 policy labs-multi-disciplinary government teams developing public services and policies using innovation methods to engage citizens and stakeholders. These policy labs use a range of innovation methods and approaches, including co-production, co-creation, co-design, behavioural insights, systems thinking, ethnography, data science, nudge theory and lean processes. Although the methods may vary, one element is consistent: policy labs actively, creatively and collaboratively engage the public and a wide range of stakeholders in jointly developing solutions. The Northern Ireland Public Sector Innovation Lab (iLab) is part of a growing UK and international community of policy labs using co-design to engage with users for value co-creation, aiming to improve public governance by creating a safe space to generate ideas, test prototypes and refine concepts with beneficiaries. Drawing on iLab's experience, this paper explores three questions: What are the main determinants of effective co-design? What are the unintended consequences of co-design? And what lessons can be learned from iLab and shared with other policy labs? IMPACT There is a need to reinstate the legitimacy of public policy-making and public service development through more effective citizen engagement. To experiment with more creative and user-centred approaches, governments are establishing Policy Labs to engage citizens at multiple stages of the development process. The Northern Ireland Public Sector Innovation Lab (iLab) is part of a growing UK and international community of Policy Labs using co-design to engage with users for value co-creation, aiming to improve public governance by creating a safe space to generate ideas, test prototypes and refine concepts with beneficiaries."

title="Soft situational strategic planning (SSSP): A method and case study of its application in a Brazilian municipality",
journal="Journal of the Operational Research Society",
abstract="Municipal government planning is challenging in the extreme being characterised by ill-structured and messy problems, the complexity of which is compounded by often conflicting views and priorities of multiple stakeholders. In South America, Situational Strategic Planning (SSP) is a wide spread method of such planning. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of a proposed multi-methodological approach, Soft Situational Strategic Planning (SSSP) in a South American municipal government. SSSP is a variant of SSP enhanced with elements of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and Strategic Choice Approach (SCA). Through an action research case study in a Brazilian municipality, we implemented SSSP through a strategic planning cycle. The findings suggest that SSSP complement the SSP process regarding the implementation and monitoring of strategy. The application also indicated that SSSP has the potential to make government planning processes more structured for policy makers."

abstract="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the extent to which service design (SD) is addressed by the client and its supply chain at a program level into one functional capability, knowledge management (KM), to share knowledge across projects and organizational actors. Design/methodology/approach - The interpretative methodology employing two methods of engaged scholarship, namely, action research and engaged research, is applied. The data are analyzed using cognitive mapping to identify the extent of alignment of perceptions. Findings - The findings show that the client and its supply chain are very transactional in their management minimizing investment in KM and program management. There is a lack of commitment and cultural leadership; hence, there is over-reliance on individuals to take responsibility for knowledge sharing and application. SD thinking can help develop a holistic approach to learning from projects. Research limitations/implications - The study underlines the links between the concepts of SD and KM. The findings emphasize the importance of developing a holistic approach to KM through the lenses of SD. The organizations must view KM as a process and build capabilities at a program level to make knowledge sharing an integral part of the work culture across projects. Originality/value - The study contributes to the subject of KM in the construction industry by mobilizing the concept of SD to examine how KM systems and procedures are embedded in the client and across its supply chain."

year="Feb",

abstract="Participatory research methods are increasingly used to collectively understand complex social-environmental problems and to design solutions through diverse and inclusive stakeholder engagement. But participatory research rarely engages stakeholders to co-develop and co-interpret models that conceptualize and quantify system dynamics for comparing scenarios of alternate action. Even fewer participatory projects have engaged people using geospatial simulations of dynamic landscape processes and spatially explicit planning scenarios. We contend that geospatial participatory modeling (GPM) can confer multiple benefits over non-spatial approaches for participatory research processes, by (a) personalizing connections to problems and their solutions through visualizations of place, (b) resolving abstract notions of landscape connectivity, and (c) clarifying the spatial scales of drivers, data, and decision-making authority. We illustrate through a case study how GPM is bringing stakeholders together to balance population growth and conservation in a coastal region facing dramatic landscape change due to urbanization and sea level rise. We find that an adaptive, iterative process of model development, sharing, and revision drive innovation of methods and ultimately improve the realism of land change models. This co-production of knowledge enables all participants to fully understand problems, evaluate the acceptability of trade-offs, and build buy-in for management actions in the places where they live and work.",

Its objective is to explore applicability of system dynamics to design a business game for fostering interpersonal skills. A causal loop diagram is used to confirm the game design so that the participants can learn by playing about importance of understanding other stakeholder's mental model to improve supply chain performance. The game was played for experiments to evaluate effectiveness of the game design by surveys and other qualitative methods such as samples' memos during the game, follow-up interviews and participatory observations. Our experimental results suggest a possibility that the game provides experiential learning to develop interpersonal skills at managing conflicts of KPIs, and thus indicate that the use of system dynamics helps to ensure appropriate designing of the game.

abstract="The risk perception paradox illustrates the perception of natural hazards as not directly related to a willingness to act or engage in precautionary behavior. Yet the utilization of participatory processes can help to overcome this gap. In a practical example in the watershed of the Danube River and its contributing streams in Germany, we aimed to solve questions about the value of participatory modeling as a method to bridge the gap linked to flood polder planning and a relocation of a dike for protection against high floods (centennial floods and rarer). Local communities, citizen initiatives, and nongovernmental environmental organizations joined together for round table discussions initiated by the water management authorities. A participatory modeling process enabled these diverse stakeholders to engage with the experts who built the groundwater models for the planning process. As part of this study, two case studies are presented. In the first example, neutral mediators assisted the round table Flood Polder Katzau (Danube) in order to cultivate mutual trust and understanding between the authorities and the former opponents of the project. This process is still ongoing, challenged by long-term planning and the more immediate obstacle of current political changes. The second case study is located on the river Alz, a tributary of the river Inn, which flows into the Danube, where the relocation of a dike was planned. This article demonstrates how participatory modeling contributes to bridging the gap between a local resident's risk perception and real action in the case of flood preparedness."

abstract="BackgroundThe Eastern Cape Province reports among the poorest health service indicators in South Africa with some of its districts standing out as worst performing as regards maternal health indicators. To understand key drivers and outcomes of this underperformance and to explore whether a participatory analysis could deepen action-oriented understanding among stakeholders, a study was conducted in one of the chronically poorly performing districts.MethodsThe study used a systems analysis approach to understand the drivers and outcomes affecting maternal health in the district in order to identify key leverage points for addressing the situation. The approach included semi-structured interviews with a total of 24 individuals consisting health system managers at various levels, health facility staff and patients. This was followed by a participatory group model building exercise with 23 key stakeholders to analyze system factors and their interrelationships affecting maternal health in the district using rich pictures and interrelationship diagraphs (IRDs) and finally the development of causal loop diagrams (CLDs).ResultsThe stakeholders were able to unpack the complex ways in which factors were interrelated in contributing to poor maternal health performance and identified the feedback loops which resulted in the situation being intractable, suggesting strategies for sustainable improvement. Quality of leadership was shown to have a pervasive influence on overall system performance by linking to numerous factors and feedback loops, including staff motivation and capacity building. Staff motivation was linked to quality of care in turn influencing patient attendance and feeding back into staff motivation through its impact on workload. Without attention to workload, patient waiting times and satisfaction, the impact of improved leadership and staff support on staff competence and attitudes would be diminished.ConclusionUnderstanding the complex interrelationships of factors in the health system is key to identifying workable solutions especially in the context of chronic health systems challenges. Systems modelling using group model building methods can be an efficient means of supporting stakeholders to recognize valuable resources within the context of a dysfunctional system to strengthen systems performance.",

An agroecological matrix approach, conceives the territory as patches of natural and cultivated vegetation, interconnected to maintain watershed integrity. Many ethnic groups maintain a high biological heterogeneity as in the case of the agrological matrix. This study analyzed features and trends in a specific agroecological matrix, integrating local and scientific knowledge with environmental and social information, as a complex system. For the last 15 years we studied agroecological spaces used by the Ntaj'uy (Zoque-Popoluca) people in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Participatory methods were used to understand social interactions and land management decisions. Ecology field methods allowed us to assess soil loss, litter production, water quality, and vegetation structure. Soil erosion, vegetation fragmentation and social marginalization are the most important problems in the region; the tropical sub-evergreen forest has decreased by about 60{\%}, the deciduous forest is down by 80{\%}, and cultivated pastures have increased over 400{\%}. Coffee and milpa agroecosystems could be improved, through product diversification, along with interconnectivity among vegetation patches, to prevent environmental degradation, and improve conditions to reach food sovereignty and income diversification, in a context of Ntaj'uy self-determination in their territories.",

abstract="In large-scale irrigation schemes built in flood plains the state of the drainage systems not only affects the performance of irrigation but also the quality of life of the population. However, maintenance of the drainage infrastructure is often neglected. This paper draws from two transdisciplinary interventions dealing with the maintenance of drainage infrastructure in the Chokwe Irrigation Scheme in Mozambique: one tested an experimental intervention that called on farmers and experts to solve local drainage issues. The other used a participatory mapping, modelling and simulation approach to discuss the barriers to upscaling different solutions at scheme levels. Managerial issues such as a good communication between actors, a good match between tasks and resources, and the scheduling of maintenance activities were important, but the most difficult challenge was addressing the underlying economic, social and political drivers that affected the relationships between actors and consequently their willingness to cooperate. Thus, the development of perennial solutions calls for (re)internalization of the social and political dimensions in scheme management and to rethink the issue of equity not as a moral injunction but as a condition for irrigation success.

The IPSM approach was formulated considering the advantages and disadvantages of existing SD modelling approaches, as well as balancing the competing goals of SD model development efficiency and robustness. A key feature of the IPSM approach is that stakeholders are central to each of the five stages of the modelling process from problem scoping, to scenario analysis and strategy implementation recommendations. Each stage of the IPSM approach was demonstrated through a case study of the innovation diffusion process in the Russian Federation construction industry. This highly complex innovation system could only be sufficiently understood using a SD model that was conceptualised, critiqued, codified, tested and utilised, by the relevant actors within that system (i.e., stakeholders). The IPSM approach facilitated the efficient formulation of the SD model for the case study application. The case study SD model simulation results indicate that sufficient government incentives and the active promotion of strong collaborative linkages between construction companies and universities are two key enablers of innovation development in the Russian Federation construction industry.",

We examine the cognitive maps of 148 thought leaders in sustainable agriculture in California and measure the extent to which each map captures six fundamental causal patterns. We find that the more complex forms of causal structure that are associated with systems thinking are relatively under-represented in the experts' maps.

abstract="The Hawaiian Islands are home to a complex and dynamic marine ecosystem that serves as a backbone to the state's economy and society's well-being. The marine ecosystem currently faces numerous threats that undermine ecosystem integrity and compromise socially valuable ecosystem services. The socio-economic and ecological complexity of the region invokes a clear need for ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies. To support EBM development, participatory methods were used to gather expert and place-based knowledge from resource managers, scientists, and community members. Methods elicited local values, fostered diverse relationships, and increased community engagement in resource management. Using information collected, Conceptual ecosystem-models were developed guided by the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework that identify and quantify the strength of socio-economic and ecological interactions. The resulting models illustrate the complexity of system dynamics, highlighting connectivity between pressures and the ecosystem, with direct implications for ecosystem services. Importantly, many identified pressures occur at the local scale, presenting an opportunity for local resource management to directly affect ecosystem status. This study also found that many of the strongly impacted ecosystem services were cultural ecosystem services, which are critical to human wellbeing but lack integration into resource management. These models support an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment of the region by informing ecosystem-based strategies, facilitating the selection of ecosystem monitoring indicators, and emphasizing human dimensions."

journal="Bmc Oral Health",
year="Jun",
volume="18",
abstract="Background: While the US population overall has experienced improvements in oral health over the past 60 years, oral diseases remain among the most common chronic conditions across the life course. Further, lack of access to oral health care contributes to profound and enduring oral health inequities worldwide. Vulnerable and underserved populations who commonly lack access to oral health care include racial/ethnic minority older adults living in urban environments. The aim of this study was to use a systematic approach to explicate cause and effect relationships in creating a causal map, a type of concept map in which the links between nodes represent causality or influence. Methods: To improve our mental models of the real world and devise strategies to promote oral health equity, methods including system dynamics, agent-based modeling, geographic information science, and social network simulation have been leveraged by the research team. The practice of systems science modeling is situated amidst an ongoing modeling process of observing the real world, formulating mental models of how it works, setting decision rules to guide behavior, and from these heuristics, making decisions that in turn affect the state of the real world. Qualitative data were obtained from focus groups conducted with community-dwelling older adults who self-identify as African American, Dominican, or Puerto Rican to elicit their lived experiences in accessing oral health care in their northern Manhattan neighborhoods. Results: The findings of this study support the multi-dimensional and multi-level perspective of access to oral health care and affirm a theorized discrepancy in fit between available dental providers and patients. The lack of information about oral health at the community level may be compromising the use and quality of oral health care among racial/ethnic minority older adults. Conclusions: Well-informed community members may fill critical roles in oral health promotion, as they are viewed as highly credible sources of information and recommendations for dental providers. The next phase of this research will involve incorporating the knowledge gained from this study into simulation models that will be used to explore alternative paths toward improving oral health and health care for racial/ethnic minority older adults.",

abstract="Background: Involving groups of community stakeholders (e.g., steering committees) to lead community wide health interventions appears to support multiple outcomes ranging from policy and systems change to individual biology. While numerous tools are available to measure stakeholder characteristics, many lack detail on reliability and validity, are not context specific, and may not be sensitive enough to capture change over time. This study describes the development and reliability of a novel survey to measure Stakeholder driven Community Diffusion via assessment of stakeholders'ocial networks, knowledge, and engagement about childhood obesity prevention. Methods: This study was completed in three phases. Phase 1 included conceptualization and online survey development through literature reviews and expert input. Phase 2 included a retrospective study with stakeholders from two completed whoileof-community interventions. Between May -ctober 2015, 21 stakeholders from the Shape Up Somerville and Romp {\&} Chomp interventions recalled their social networks, knowledge, and engagement pre-post intervention. We also assessed one-week test-retest reliability of knowledge and engagement survey modules among Shape Up Somerville respondents. Phase 3 included survey modifications and a second prospective reliability assessment. Test-retest reliability was assessed in May 2016 among 13 stakeholders involved in ongoing interventions in Victoria, Australia. Results: in Phase 1, we developed a survey with 7, 20 and 50 items for the social networks, knowledge, and engagement survey modules, respectively, in the Phase 2 retrospective study, Shape Up Somerville and Romp {\&} Chomp networks included 99 and 54 individuals. Pre-post Shape Up Somerviill and Romp {\&} Chomp mean knowledge scores increased by 3.5 points (95{\%} QCI 0.35 6.72) and (- 0.42 7.42). Engagement scores did not change significantly (Shape Up Somerville: 1.1 points (- 0.55 2.73); Romp {\&} Chomp: 0.7 points (- 0.43 1.73)). Intraclass correlation coefficients (iICs) for knowledge and engagement were 0.88 (0.67 -.97) and 0.97 (0.89 -.99). In Phase 3, the modified knowledge and engagement survey modules included 18 and 25 items, respectively. Knowledge and engagement iICs were 0.84 (0.62-0.95) and 0.58 (0.23 -.86). Conclusions: The survey measures upstream stakeholder properties-social networks, knowledge, and engagement-with good test retest reliability. Future research related to Stakeholder driven Community Diffusion should focus on prospective change and survey validation for intervention effectiveness.",

Using local solar expert stakeholder input into a participatory systems approach, this study provides a structural analysis of factors influencing household solar adoption. The approach is applied and assessed for household solar PV systems in Santiago, Chile, to gain insight into the interconnected factors driving technology adoption. Barriers and motivations to adoption identified in a recent Delphi study for Santiago were used to create a list of factors thought by local experts to impact future adoption. These factors and their pairwise interactions were modeled using the impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) technique and analyzed within a four-hour workshop with eight solar experts in Santiago. Results from the analysis regarding factor influence, dependence and evolutionary trajectories were presented to experts and discussed at length. Salient discussion points focused on the need for attractive financial incentives, knowledge diffusion among potential consumers, and a maturing market that incites a cultural shift towards customers who desire energy independence. Intuitive and insightful programmatic areas were illuminated for policy and action in Santiago based on a systems-focused interpretation of factors in the form of short-and long-term strategies.",

abstract="Systemic threats to food-energy-environment-water systems require national policy responses. Yet complete control of these complex systems is impossible and attempts to mitigate systemic risks can generate unexpected feedback effects. Perverse outcomes from national policy can emerge from the diverse responses of decision-makers across different levels and scales of resource governance. Participatory risk assessment processes can help planners to understand subnational dynamics and ensure that policies do not undermine the resilience of social-ecological systems and infrastructure networks. Researchers can play an important role in participatory processes as both technical specialists and brokers of stakeholder knowledge on the feedbacks generated by systemic risks and policy decisions. Here, we evaluate the use of causal modeling and participatory risk assessment to develop national policy on systemic water risks. We present an application of the Risks and Options Assessment for Decision-Making (ROAD) process to a district of Vietnam where national agricultural water reforms are being piloted. The methods and results of this project provide general insights about how to support resilient decision-making, including the transfer of knowledge across administrative levels, identification of feedback effects, and the effective implementation of risk assessment processes."

number="1-2",
pages="107-133",
abstract="This article outlines a reconfiguration of the ``network'' trope as a means of conducting reflexive, applied research on society, technology, and music, towards positive social transformation, with application in post-war Liberia. In the social sciences, the mathematical concept of graph or network has provided a powerful paradigm both for scientific explanation and humanistic understanding, through social network analysis. Its application in the present article transcends these applications through a shift in emphasis, from explanation and understanding to social transformations, induced by forging new transnational networks out of the collaborative, iterative cycles of participatory action research (PAR) centered on music, digital musical production, and sociomusical relationships. These networks are designed to address what the UN has identified as the ``responsibility to protect'' (R2P), as a means of mitigating that dehumanisation underlying all human rights abuses. Beyond explanation or understanding, I emphasise PAR networks as tools and instances of social transformation, not only as means, but as ends in themselves, holding that the right sort of transnational social network a harmoniously interacting global community is precisely what is sought. Further, whereas the network actor is typically either human (in social network analysis) or non-human (in much network science), I combine the two in applied research, building on Latour's ``Actor Network Theory'' (ANT) in two respects. First, beyond joining the human and nonhuman I consider also their double intersection: the expressive arts (including music) as the human nonhuman; and dehumanisation as the nonhuman human. Second, I extend such constructivism to transformative participatory action research. The chapter charts the iterative formation of a transnational PAR actor-network, including Liberian refugee musicians, academics, students, and producers, constituting both method and objective for applied ethnomusicology. I identify thethe digital song (manifesting in multiple remixes) as flexible mediator, its potential remixes enhancing connectivity, forging harmoniously interacting transnational actor-networks via people, technology, and music. Such networks not only facilitate a better world, they embody it."

Our findings show that all innovation systems functions required multilevel action, but that fulfillment of specific functions demands for strategic involvement of specific stakeholders at specific levels. We observed that a research-and dissemination-oriented sequence in the functions was prioritized in AR4D IPs and argue that such a sequence may be different in other types of (business) IPs. Our findings provide an incentive to think function oriented about compositional dynamics (stakeholder groups * levels) in innovation processes, rather than striving for equal stakeholder participation."

abstract="The distressed areas and improvement of living atmosphere is one of the complex and multi-dimensional subjects in the field of urban design and management. Considering the importance of this subject, so may laws and policies have been issued by governments and policy makers; however, a significant improvement has not been observed in this filed. One of the reasons for the lack of development is the multi expertise nature of the regeneration programs and the diversity of projects along with the different stakeholders from private and governmental institutions that need complex coordinating plans. In the other words, the regeneration of deteriorated areas has the attitudes of a program, which a network of stakeholders have essential roles in its achievements and one of the important issues for reaching the end points of the program is governance of these stakeholders. Therefore, recognizing the structure of the stakeholder networks' governance and criticizing it can lead to the success of these programs. As one of the most important aspects of the regeneration programs' governance is the collaboration between nodes, this article has quantified the degree of the collaboration between nodes of the stakeholders' network of Tehran regeneration program by using the focus group method. Then the results have been used as the date for Social Network Analysis (SNA) method which is a great program for analyzing the different aspects of the networks. Then by using SNA, the degree of collaboration of Tehran regeneration program's governance network is identified and is compared to the ideal form of collaborative governance structure introduced in the literature to make some suggestion for making the improvements."

The integrated modelling framework allows to evaluate stakeholders' policy acceptability taking into account their heterogeneous preferences and their interactive behaviour. The stakeholder behavioural analysis proposed, together with technical and economic analyses, contributes to the ex-ante policy assessment needed to support policy-makers in taking well thought-out decisions. An application of the modelling framework is here presented with the aim to prove its feasibility and added value for UFT policy-making, since it provides a ranking of policies that are likely to be accepted by stakeholders and that satisfy their heterogeneous desires and objectives while accounting for interaction effects.

abstract="Symbiotic Urban Agriculture Networks (SUANs) are a specific class of symbiotic networks that intend to close material and energy loops from cities and urban agriculture. Private and public stakeholders in SUANs face difficulties in the implementation of technological and organisational design interventions due to the complex nature of the agricultural and urban environment. Current research on the dynamics of symbiotic networks, especially Industrial Symbiosis (IS), is based on historical data from practice, and provides only partly for an understanding of symbiotic networks as a sociotechnical complex adaptive system. By adding theory and methodology from Design Science, participatory methods, and by using agent-based modelling as a tool, prescriptive knowledge is developed in the form of grounded and tested design rules for SUANs. In this paper, we propose a conceptual Design Science method with the aim to develop an empirically validated participatory agent-based modelling strategy that guides sociotechnical design interventions in SUANs. In addition, we present a research agenda for further strategy, design intervention, and model development through case studies regarding SUANs. The research agenda complements the existing analytical work by adding a necessary Design Science approach, which contributes to bridging the gap between IS dynamics theory and practical complex design issues.",

abstract="Coral reef resource systems are complex adaptive social-ecological systems providing vital and valuable ecosystem services for human societies such as food provision, coastal protection and recreational activities. Their sustainability is questioned in many places around the world as they experience combined effects of multiple chronic anthropogenic and natural drivers at local to global scales. From a management perspective, there is a crucial need to understand how the impact of these drivers cascade through the social-ecological system components. This study develops a transdisciplinary and participatory approach to investigating the social-ecological dynamics of a Polynesian coral reef coastal system. A preliminary conceptual model using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact (DPSI) framework is first being built through participatory modeling workshops. Then, pressure-state relationships are assessed with the help of empirical datasets as a first step towards the validation of the DPSI model. Results shows striking social-ecological interactions with different patterns in the lagoon and in the fore reef. Local management should be: (1) less resource-focused to account more specifically to the existing typology of actors; (2) more spatially-explicit to better distinguish management objectives and actions for the lagoon and the fore reef sub-systems; and (3) more coordinated with terrestrial agencies for a coherent land-sea connection and integration that would both (i) account for existing land-sea interactions and (ii) better reflect the Polynesian cultural heritage that considers nature from ridge to reef as a whole. Such conceptual models of social-ecological systems are a useful tool to build exploratory scenarios to ultimately support planning decision-making processes."

Uncertainty and inequality in such systems require research and development interventions to be adaptive, support learning and to engage with underlying drivers of poverty. Such complexity-aware approaches to planning, monitoring and evaluating development interventions are gaining strength, yet, there is still little empirical evidence of what it takes to implement them in practice. In this paper, we share learning from an agricultural research program that used participatory action research and theory of change to foster learning and support transformative change in aquatic agricultural systems. We reflect on our use of critical reflection within participatory agricultural research interventions, and our use of theory of change to collectively surface and revisit assumptions about how change happens. We share learning on the importance of being strengths-based in engaging stakeholders across scales and building a common goal as a starting point, and then staging a more critical practice as capacity is built and opportunities for digging deeper emerge.",

abstract="Participatory scenario processes are associated with positive social learning outcomes, including consensus-building and shifts toward more systemic thinking. However, these claims have not been assessed quantitatively in diverse cultural and socio-ecological settings. We convened three stakeholder workshops around the future of agricultural development and rural livelihoods in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Malawi, using a participatory scenario generation process to examine proposed research and action priorities under conditions of uncertainty. We administered pre- and post-workshop surveys, and used a paired t-test to assess how stakeholders' rankings of research priorities changed after participating in the scenario visioning exercise. Workshop participants also listed their own priorities for research and implementation on both the pre- and post-survey forms. We found indications that the workshops promoted consensus-building around the research priorities, including a reduction in standard deviation of priority rankings post-workshop compared to pre- workshop; and a higher incidence of identical volunteered responses. We did not find evidence to support shifts in thinking to more systemic views of agricultural development. However, participants viewed themselves as having learned throughout the process. We conclude that scenario visioning does have the potential to foster consensus-building (one element of social learning) among diverse stakeholder groups. We urge researchers to continue to monitor and measure systems thinking outcomes from scenario visioning so that these processes may be designed to be more effective.",

abstract="Finding land use strategies that merge land-based climate change mitigation measures and adaptation strategies is still an open issue in climate discourse. This article explores synergies and trade-offs between REDD+, a scheme that focuses mainly on mitigation through forest conservation, with ``Climate Smart Agriculture'', an approach that emphasizes adaptive agriculture. We introduce a framework for ex ante assessment of the impact of land management policies and interventions and for quantifying their impacts on land-based mitigation and adaptation goals. The framework includes a companion modelling (ComMod) process informed by interviews with policymakers, local experts and local farmers. The ComMod process consists of a Role-Playing Game with local farmers and an Agent Based Model. The game provided a participatory means to develop policy and climate change scenarios. These scenarios were then used as inputs to the Agent Based Model, a spatially explicit model to simulate landscape dynamics and the associated carbon emissions over decades. We applied the framework using as case study a community in central Vietnam, characterized by deforestation for subsistence agriculture and cultivation of acacias as a cash crop. The main findings show that the framework is useful in guiding consideration of local stakeholders' goals, needs and constraints. Additionally the framework provided beneficial information to policymakers, pointing to ways that policies might be re-designed to make them better tailored to local circumstances and therefore more effective in addressing synergistically climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.

Key research themes include: identifying farmers' agricultural production networks; the local articulation of agricultural production networks and mindsets; using networks to facilitate meaningful participation in technology development; and disadvantages and advantages of using a social network approach. The introduction of SNA improved participatory research by building external and internal legitimacy for determining who participates, discouraging participatory attrition, and providing a meaningful forum for participation of all stakeholders. As a result, the introduction of SNA is demonstrated to show strong promise for improving processes of participatory technology development in agriculture."

volume="3",
abstract="Climate change affects the marine environment at all levels of governance. At a global level, researchers expect the projected increase in sea surface temperature to facilitate large changes in the marine food web, which in turn will affect both global fisheries and aquaculture. At the local level, government and stakeholders want to know whether and how this affects their local communities and their adaptive capacity in light of this. Research suggests that risk communication of the effects of changes in the marine food web suffers from stakeholders' short-term mentality and narrow boundaries. This in turn can lead to an underestimation of the potential risks associated with climate change. We explore this theory by mapping the perceptions of marine stakeholders in the region of Troms, Norway. We first developed cognitive maps in a workshop setting, and then used system conceptualization to analyze the feedback mechanisms of the system qualitatively using fuzzy cognitive mapping. We examined the outcomes and compared them for different scenarios using a simple MatLab script. Results demonstrated that stakeholders did not underestimate their risks to climate change. They were aware of environmental changes, and they perceived that a changing climate was the cause of this change, and that it was indeed affecting their livelihoods-and would continue to do so in the future.",

abstract="This paper proposes the use of agent-based models (ABMs) as ``interested amateurs'' in policy making, and uses the example of the SWAP model of soil and water conservation adoption to demonstrate the potential of this approach. Daniel Dennett suggests experts often talk past or misunderstand each other, seek to avoid offending each other or appearing ill-informed and generally err on the side of under-explaining a topic. Dennett suggests that these issues can be overcome by including ``interested amateurs'' in discussions between experts. In the context of land use policy debates, and policy making more generally, this paper suggests that ABMs have particular characteristics that make them excellent potential ``interested amateurs'' in discussions between our experts: policy stakeholders. This is demonstrated using the SWAP (Soil and Water Conservation Adoption) model, which was used with policy stakeholders in Ethiopia. The model was successful in focussing discussion, inviting criticism, dealing with sensitive topics and drawing out understanding between stakeholders. However, policy stakeholders were still hesitant about using such a tool. This paper reflects on these findings and attempts to plot a way forward for the use of ABMs as ``interested amateurs'' and, in the process, make clear the differences in approach to other participatory modelling efforts."

abstract="Purpose - Interventions to support gender equality in organisations are often unsuccessful. Stakeholders disagree about the causes and problem definition of gender equality or pay lip service to the principle of gender equality, but fail to implement gender equality in practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine participatory modelling as an intervention method to support stakeholders in: reaching a shared problem definition and analysis of gender inequality; and identifying and implementing policies to tackle gender inequality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply participatory modelling in case studies on impediments to women's careers in two Dutch universities. Findings - This study shows that participatory modelling supported stakeholders' identification of the self-reinforcing feedback processes of masculinity of norms, visibility of women and networking of women and the interrelatedness between these processes. Causal loop diagrams visualise how the feedback processes are interrelated and can stabilise or reinforce themselves. Moreover, they allow for the identification of possible interventions. Research limitations/implications - Further testing of the causal loop diagrams by quantifying the stocks and the flows would validate the feedback processes and the estimated effects of possible interventions. Practical implications - The integration of the knowledge of researchers and stakeholders in a causal loop diagram supported learning about the issue of gender inequality, hereby contributing to transformative change on gender equality.

title="The structure of policy-induced innovation networks in Slovenia",
journal="European Journal of Innovation Management",
year="2015",
volume="18",
number="4",
pages="428-450",
abstract="Purpose - The recent economic crisis has significantly slowed Slovenia's recent social and economic progress and exposed some important long-term problems such as a reliance on low value added industries and lagging labor productivity. The Slovenian government has taken steps to create research partnerships between public science and the private sector and among multiple private sector companies. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a social network analysis (SNA) of the research partnerships and examine whether public funding has created the desired partnerships. Design/methodology/approach - The authors employed a SNA in two stages. In the first stage, the authors treated the founding partners of government-funded 32 research centers as a single two-mode network and investigated how each of the members was bound to the network. In the second stage of the analysis the authors used project data from ten of the centers to characterize a project network based on collaborations on specific projects. Thus, the second stage overlaps the center network with the project network. The authors used information from interviews with network members to assist in interpreting the results. Findings - Networking policies are stimulating collaborations among different types of centers and partners, but to differing degrees. While the formal collaborative network showed strong participation from the private sector, public research organizations, and higher education institutions, some of the centers are not well connected to the rest of the network. Partnership in the development of a proposal in response to a tender does not always translate into project collaboration, and the networks have evolved as project workplans and staffing plans are developed. The innovation network is evolving into an international network within and across scientific areas. Networks are path dependent and require policy stability; experienced bridging institutions can fill gaps where partners lack experience. Research limitations/implications - The definition of a network member is the company, faculty, or department. In reality, individuals within these organizations are acting on their own connections and experiences, and these may or may not encourage other individuals in the same organization to engage in partnerships. Thus, the authors may be overstating the extent to which one connection among organizations generates experience that will lead to future connection. Another important limitation of the data is that for the second stage of the analysis the authors received project information from only ten of the 32 formal center programs examined in the first stage. Practical implications - Partnership is a learned behavior and the development of trust among partners takes time. The Slovenian government should provide policy stability and allow niches of technical excellence to emerge through consortium proposals. They should monitor the project partnerships and adjust funding so that it is reaching applicants that are actually partnering on projects rather than working alone or within their own institutional types. Other nations should also monitor the impact of partnership programs to ensure that as they evolve the funding is continuing to support and demonstrate the benefits partnership behavior. Social implications - Due to the path dependent nature of innovation partnerships, the authors expect participation in innovation networks to generate a change in the culture of research and development (R{\&}D) partnerships in Slovenia. However, this transition will occur faster as organizations partner face-to-face on actual projects. Centrality in a network fosters common understanding and shared principles of collaboration. Originality/value - Like many nations struggling to emerge from the recession, Slovenia has to examine its long-term strategy for upgrading its industries and improving productivity. This paper demonstrates how policies to enhance the innovation agenda might be more effective by examining how the networking resources are actually being used, whether participants are participating in networks that cross institutional types, whether policies are encouraging the exchange of information across stages of the innovation process, and therefore whether the policy will move the culture toward greater collaboration and R{\&}D effectiveness. The results can assist Slovenia's policymakers in redesigning innovation network policy.",

journal="Health Research Policy and Systems",
year="Aug",
volume="12",
abstract="Background: Health systems strengthening is becoming a key component of development agendas for low-income countries worldwide. Systems thinking emphasizes the role of diverse stakeholders in designing solutions to system problems, including sustainability. The objective of this paper is to compare the definition and use of sustainability indicators developed through the Sustainability Analysis Process in two rehabilitation sectors, one in Nepal and one in Somaliland, and analyse the contextual factors (including the characteristics of system stakeholder networks) influencing the use of sustainability data. Methods: Using the Sustainability Analysis Process, participants collectively clarified the boundaries of their respective systems, defined sustainability, and identified sustainability indicators. Baseline indicator data was gathered, where possible, and then researched again 2 years later. As part of the exercise, system stakeholder networks were mapped at baseline and at the 2-year follow-up. We compared stakeholder networks and interrelationships with baseline and 2-year progress toward self-defined sustainability goals. Using in-depth interviews and observations, additional contextual factors affecting the use of sustainability data were identified. Results: Differences in the selection of sustainability indicators selected by local stakeholders from Nepal and Somaliland reflected differences in the governance and structure of the present rehabilitation system. At 2 years, differences in the structure of social networks were more marked. In Nepal, the system stakeholder network had become more dense and decentralized. Financial support by an international organization facilitated advancement toward self-identified sustainability goals. In Somaliland, the small, centralised stakeholder network suffered a critical rupture between the system's two main information brokers due to competing priorities and withdrawal of international support to one of these. Progress toward self-defined sustainability was nil. Conclusions: The structure of the rehabilitation system stakeholder network characteristics in Nepal and Somaliland evolved over time and helped understand the changing nature of relationships between actors and their capacity to work as a system rather than a sum of actors. Creating consensus on a common vision of sustainability requires additional system-level interventions such as identification of and support to stakeholders who promote systems thinking above individual interests.",

abstract="The objective of articulating sustainability visions through modeling is to enhance the outcomes and process of visioning in order to successfully move the system toward a desired state. Models emphasize approaches to develop visions that are viable and resilient and are crafted to adhere to sustainability principles. This approach is largely assembled from visioning processes (resulting in descriptions of desirable future states generated from stakeholder values and preferences) and participatory modeling processes (resulting in systems-based representations of future states co-produced by experts and stakeholders). Vision modeling is distinct from normative scenarios and backcasting processes in that the structure and function of the future desirable state is explicitly articulated as a systems model. Crafting, representing and evaluating the future desirable state as a systems model in participatory settings is intended to support compliance with sustainability visioning quality criteria (visionary, sustainable, systemic, coherent, plausible, tangible, relevant, nuanced, motivational and shared) in order to develop rigorous and operationalizable visions. We provide two empirical examples to demonstrate the incorporation of vision modeling in research practice and education settings. In both settings, vision modeling was used to develop, represent, simulate and evaluate future desirable states. This allowed participants to better identify, explore and scrutinize sustainability solutions."

These insights are based on an ongoing transdisciplinary research collaboration (2008-present) using action research methods; we focus on the faculty experience. Accepting the metaphors of complex systems, we describe the systemic conditions that seem to repeatedly reproduce the emergence of transformative learning for participants, as well as what one might expect to experience in the process. These experiences include: conflict, existential crisis, transformation and renewed vitality within the necessary context of a safe and caring community. Without the adoption of complexity metaphors, these elements would have been overlooked or interpreted as a hindrance to the work. These insights are intended to serve as socially robust knowledge to support the effective participation of faculty members in sustainability projects of a transdisciplinary nature."

abstract="This paper focuses on the collective design and immediate execution of an agent-based model (ABM) by dynamically interpreting the activity diagrams of agent behaviours. To reach this objective, we have implemented an ABM of livestock producers facing drought conditions in Uruguay. The first step consists in implementing a standard ABM with pasture growth, herd dynamics and simple agents roughly imitating farmers' strategies. The second step is more participative since it consists in assessing the model with the real cattle farmers. As with most modelling processes, this evaluation phase requires feedback on model design. In order to make this assessment more lively and efficient, we have conceived a tool for drawing diagrams that can be immediately interpreted by the agents. Thanks to this new editor, the actors have quickly understood how the model worked and were able to criticize and modify it. Thus, this innovative modelling tool enables the involvement of stakeholders in co-designing ABM for participatory foresight studies. We hope it will facilitate the emergence of new and more efficient practices for farm management that can account for climate changes.",

pages="58-77",
abstract="Degrowth has been put forward as a transition pathway towards a socially and ecologically sustainable future. Many diverse actions have been proposed in the context of degrowth. To the outsider the debate might seem somewhat unfocussed. This article reveals the links and complementarities between emblematic degrowth proposals, and provides a toolkit for developing a more coherent picture on how overdeveloped societies may make a transition to more frugal and convivial futures. We use the method of Causal Loop Diagramming in a collaborative setting involving researchers and activists engaged with degrowth issues. First we derive collaboratively the dominant feedback processes in the current social, ecological and economic systems and we identify leverage points for systemic interventions to facilitate degrowth. By explicitly representing the main causal chains of effects it is possible to reveal insights on the consequences of a given proposal and explore ``what-if?'' questions and future pathways. In addition we construct a compatibility matrix to identify the possible synergies between emblematic degrowth proposals. The results from these two exercises are integrated to provide plausible pathways for the implementation of degrowth policies, with a systemic identification of risks, uncertainties and leverage points of intervention. Participatory systems thinking tools have much to offer in envisioning contractional, macro-pathways towards sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

It is informed by those frameworks but differs insofar as it puts more emphasis on a constructivist conception which recognises that sustainability needs to be defined anew for each planning problem. In finding such a consensus definition, POSAF uses participatory scenario analysis and participatory planning, technical feasibility study, participatory assessment, analysis of trade-offs and social networks in an unusual combination and for goals that differ from the original conceptions of these methods. POSAF was applied in a pen-urban area of Mexico City for the design of improved water service provision, integrating solid waste management. It supported consensus amongst users about the importance of environmental issues, informed planners about the values of stakeholders and users, detected local differences, and identified possible conflicts at an early stage of decision-making., (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

New policy and program approaches are needed to restore and sustain natural systems as public agencies and organizations face greater demands and declining budgets. Environmental stewardship is an often overlooked intervention strategy, and the full potential of civic engagement by citizens on behalf of ecosystem health is little understood. Using a coupled systems approach, integrated analysis of social and ecological footprints can lead to greater theoretical understanding and more effective programs at the landscape scale. Here we outline two pilot studies as part of an emergent research program that is investigating the extent and impact of environmental stewardship. Qualitative interviews of stewardship managers revealed multiple dimensions of motivations and purposes for stewardship, ranging from the practical to the conceptual. A regional organization census yielded a surprisingly large number of organizations that conduct stewardship, with social and ecological values being of comparable emphasis. The initial research is based in the Puget Sound area of Washington State, U.S., but results have relevance to other urban areas. Pilot study findings now guide additional research effort about motivations, organizational networks, and theory of integrated socio-ecological systems to be derived from comprehensive footprint analysis of stewardship activity.",

While efforts to evaluate the ecological fit of institutions to place have become more sophisticated, efforts to measure the social fit of policy remains underdeveloped. In order to examine the effect of institutional form on policy processes and socially relevant outcomes, I employ a mixed methods approach including ethnographic data and social network analysis to compare the implementation of two international wildlife regimes in two indigenous Inupiaq towns in Alaska. My results yield three findings: (1) that separate institutions create differently structured policy networks, (2) differences in network structures and levels of power-sharing correlate with perceptions of policy, and (3) networks that reflect local social patterns are more likely to be considered fair and inclusive. These findings support congruence theory, which posits that public policy reflective of local constructions of legitimacy will achieve greater success than policy that is not reflective.

abstract="Many coastal areas throughout the world are at risk from sea level rise and the increased intensity of extreme events such as storm surge and flooding. Simultaneously, many areas are also experiencing significant socio-economic challenges associated with rural-urban transitions, population growth, and increased consumption resulting from improving gross regional product. Within this context we explore the viability of proposed adaptation pathways in Soc Trang province, Vietnam-an area of the Mekong Delta experiencing cumulative pressures on coastal livelihoods. A participatory workshop and interviews, using a combination of systems thinking and futures techniques, revealed a shared goal of sustainable livelihoods, which provides an integrated and systemic focus for coastal adaptation strategies. Emphasizing sustainable livelihoods is less likely to lead to maladaptation because stakeholders consciously seek to avoid optimizing particular system elements at the expense of others-and thus engage in broader decision-making frameworks supportive of social-ecological resilience. However, the broad ambit required for sustainable livelihoods is not supported by governance frameworks that have focused on protective strategies (e.g., dyke building, strengthening and raising, to continue and expand agriculture and aquaculture production) at the expense of developing a diverse suite of adaptation strategies, which may lead to path dependencies and an ultimate reduction in adaptive capacity for system transformation."

As co-facilitators of this process based in a Northern research institution, we reflect upon the challenges, limitations and benefits of the approach used in order to identify potential areas for improvement and to understand how the dynamics of this partnership shaped collaboration. We also discuss how employing a systemic approach to action research helped to provide insights into the interactions between the physical and environmental impacts of climate change and related systems such as land tenure and agricultural production. A systemic approach to PAR, we argue, lends itself especially well to analysis of climate change adaptation and resilience, both of which are embedded within complex systems of institutions, assets, individuals and structures, and therefore not appropriate for narrow or one-dimensional analyses. Finally, we consider the specific contributions and challenges that engaging community radio as a research partner may offer to investigations on climate change.",

abstract="The Dzanga-Sangha landscape consists of a national park surrounded by production forest. It is subject to an integrated conservation and development project (ICDP). In collaboration with the ICDP personnel, a participatory model was constructed to explore wildlife conservation and industrial logging scenarios for the landscape. Three management options for the landscape's production forest were modelled: (I) 'predatory logging', exploitation by a logging company characterised by a lack of long-term plans for staying in the landscape, (II) sustainable exploitation by a certified logging company, and (III) conservation concession with no commercial timber harvesting. The simulation outcomes indicate the extreme difficulties to achieve progress on either conservation or development scenarios. Both logging scenarios give best outcomes for development of the local population. However, the depletion of bushmeat under the predatory logging scenario negatively impacts the population, especially the BaAka pygmy minority who most strongly depend on hunting for their income. The model suggests that conservation and development outcomes are largely determined by the level of economic activity, both inside and outside the landscape. Large investments in the formal sector in the landscape without any measures for protecting wildlife (Scenario I) leads to some species going nearly extinct, while investments in the formal sector including conservation measures (Scenario II) gives best outcomes for maintaining wildlife populations. The conservation concession at simulated investment levels does not reduce poverty, defined here in terms of monetary income. Neither does it seem capable of maintaining wildlife populations since the landscape is already filled with settlers lacking economic opportunities as alternatives to poaching."

abstract="Ethiopian agriculture is changing as new actors, relationships, and policies influence the ways in which small-scale, resource-poor farmers access and use information and knowledge in their agricultural production decisions. Although these changes suggest new opportunities for smallholders, too little is known about how changes will ultimately improve the wellbeing of smallholders in Ethiopia. Thus, we examine whether these changes are improving the ability of smallholders to innovate and thus improve their own welfare. In doing so, we analyze interactions between smallholders and other actors to provide new perspectives on the role played by smallholder innovation networks in the agricultural sector by drawing on data from community case studies conducted in 10 localities. Findings suggest that public extension and administration exert a strong influence over smallholder networks, potentially crowding out market-based and civil society actors, and thus limiting beneficial innovation processes. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest the need to further explore policies and programs that create more space for market and civil society to participate in smallholder innovation networks and improve welfare. From a conceptual and methodological perspective, our findings suggest the need to incorporate rigorous applications of social network analysis into the application of innovation systems theory."

The process of developing a systems model uses the tenets of scientific theory, hypothesis testing and clear statements of assumptions.

abstract="We describe an action-research project whose objective was to help stakeholders at different organisational levels achieve sustainable land management by developing mediation models and tools. We chose to test a specific approach called companion modelling in the framework of a multidisciplinary research partnership and a formal local partnership (a 'users committee') involving an array of stakeholders at different organisational levels. The study area covers 10,000 km(2) of agro-pastoral land around Lake Guiers in northern Senegal. We conducted studies to update the knowledge base of the area and organised six field workshops that clearly revealed three important tool functions to support decision-making on land use at different scales, i.e. understanding maps, monitoring and evaluating land tenure, and foreseeing changes in land use. We found that a toolbox approach was the best way to implement the three functions and overcome the constraints faced by the research team and those linked to the timing of the project. Therefore, we produced five simple complementary tools aimed at various users: a farm-level optimisation model (for researchers and technical services), a database for land allocations and a discussion tool to assess the impact of land allocation decisions (for the rural council), a paper atlas (for local players) and a regional land use change simulation model (for regional and national planners). Participants were able to work with paper maps, to interpret computer-generated simulations of land use change and understand the strengths and limitations of each. Self-assessment of the research process emphasised the importance of the context and the critical role played by social capital at both the research and the field level, which, in turn, emphasised the need for major improvements in the design and implementation of a quality process for participatory modelling. It turns out that action-research may be an effective way to undertake sustainability science."

This paper tests the conjecture that systems thinking and the qualitative politicized influence diagram (QPID) are an appropriate lens through which to study B2B information systems.

abstract="Understanding stakeholders' perceptions and motivations is of significant importance in relation to conservation and protected area projects. The importance of stakeholder analysis is widely recognized as a necessary means for gaining insight into the complex systemic interactions between natural processes, management policies, and local people depending on the resource. Today, community and group-based participatory inquiry approaches are widely used for this purpose. Recently, participatory approaches have been critiqued for not considering power relations and conflict internal to the community. In this article, we suggest that the five-step Rapid Stakeholder and Conflict Assessment (RSCA) methodology addresses this critique. The objective of the methodology is to provide a facilitator with a comprehensive foundation on which to plan and conduct subsequent participatory project development. The RSCA integrates elements of soft systems and critical systems thinking. Qualitative research interviews and cognitive mapping of stakeholders' mental models are used for collection of empirical material and analysis. The RSCA methodology is demonstrated in a case study concerning buffer zone management in the coastal wetlands of southern Vietnam. The case study shows that the RSCA methodology can provide an efficient way of obtaining a holistic and critical understanding of a complex resource management situation, thus potentially enhancing project performance in an instrumental as well as an ethical sense."

In the first case study, based in Zimbabwe, Bayesian or Belief Networks were used in a project designed to enhance the adaptive management capacity of a community in a semiarid rangeland system. In the second case study, based in Senegal, multi-agent systems models were used in the context of role plays to communicate research findings to a community, as well as to explore policies for improved management of rangelands and arable lands over which herders and farmers were in conflict. The paper provides examples of the use of computer-based modeling with stakeholders who had limited experience with computer systems and numerical analyses. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the major lessons learned from the two independent case studies. Perhaps the most important lesson was the development of a common understanding of a problem through the development of the models with key stakeholders. A second key lesson was the need for research to be adaptive if it were to benefit adaptive managers. Both case study situations required significant changes in project orientation as stakeholder needs were defined. Both case studies recognized the key role that research, and particularly the development of models, played in bring different actors together to formulate improved management strategies or policies. Participatory engagement with stakeholders is a time-consuming and relatively costly process in which, in the case studies, most of the costs were born by the research projects themselves. We raise the concern that these activities may not be widely replicable if such costs are not reduced or born by the stakeholders themselves.",

An adaptation of soft systems methodology has been used to identify mutually beneficial improvements in management between villager, agency and commercial stakeholders. In the Thai situation,, it is doubtful to what degree the less powerful village stakeholders wish to 'emancipate' themselves out of the institutional protocols of patron-client relationships, as against building further patronage relationships with multiple agency and commercial patrons. Rather than seeking a normative compass through 'emancipation' as a universal ethic, perhaps we should look to the creative potential within ourselves, and within our cultures.

abstract="Background: The growing burden of non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries presents substantive challenges for health systems. This is also the case in fragile, post-conflict and post-Ebola Sierra Leone, where NCDs represent an increasingly significant disease burden (around 30{\%} of adult men and women have raised blood pressure). To date, documentation of health system challenges and opportunities for NCD prevention and control is limited in such settings. This paper aims to identify opportunities and challenges in provision of NCD prevention and care and highlight lessons for Sierra Leone and other fragile states in the battle against the growing NCD epidemic. Methods: This paper focuses on the case of Sierra Leone and uses a combination of participatory group model building at national and district level, in rural and urban districts, interviews with 28 key informants and review of secondary data and documents. Data is analysed using the WHO's health system assessment guide for NCDs. Results: We highlight multiple challenges typical to those encountered in other fragile settings to the delivery of preventive and curative NCD services. There is limited government and donor commitment to financing and implementation of the national NCD policy and strategy, limited and poorly distributed health workforce and pharmaceuticals, high financial barriers for users, and lack of access to quality-assured medicines with consequent high recourse to private and informal care seeking. We identify how to strengthen the system within existing (low) resources, including through improved clinical guides and tools, more effective engagement with communities, and regulatory and fiscal measures. Conclusion: Our study suggests that NCD prevention and control is of low but increasing priority in Sierra Leone; challenges to addressing this burden relate to huge numbers with NCDs (especially hypertension) requiring care, overall resource constraints and wider systemic issues, including poorly supported primary care services and access barriers. In addition to securing and strengthening political will and commitment and directing more resources and attention towards this area, there is a need for in-depth exploratory and implementation research to shape and test NCD interventions in fragile and post-conflict settings.",

abstract="We created a tool for use by the community of Tippecanoe County Indiana and their Opioid Task Force to guide their collaborative efforts in addressing the opioid crisis. A community-engaged research strategy led to the creation of a map of opioid pathways based in a systems thinking approach that considers key stakeholders and community members as system components and reflects local resources, supply, and demand for services, and the social ecology unique to this community. Organizations are able to visualize the importance of their interactions with other organizations within the community as they work together to address the crisis. This approach could be replicated in other communities and used to address other public health issues.",

pages="179-184",
abstract="We report on the first 18 months of two communities' efforts using methods inspired by community-based participatory system dynamics for the development, implementation, and evaluation of whole of community efforts to improve the health of children. We apply Foster-Fishman's theoretical framework for characterizing systems change to describe the initiatives. Bounding the system began with defining leaders more broadly than standard health interventions to be those who had the ability to change environments to improve health, including food retailers, government, and business, and using high-quality childhood monitoring data to define the problem. Widespread access to junk food, barriers to physical activity, and efforts to promote health predominantly through programmatic approaches were identified as potential root causes. System interactions existed in the form of relationships between stakeholder groups and organizations. The approach described built new relationships and strengthened existing relationships. Willingness in taking risks, changing existing practice, and redesigning health promotion work to have a community development focus, were levers for change. This approach has resulted in hundreds of community-led actions focused on changing norms and environments. Insights from this approach may be useful to support other communities in translating systems theory into systems practice. Further empirical research is recommended to explore the observations in this paper.",

title="Generating political commitment for ending malnutrition in all its forms: A system dynamics approach for strengthening nutrition actor networks",
journal="Obesity Reviews",
year="2019",
volume="20 Suppl 2",
pages="30-44",
abstract="Generating political commitment for ending all forms of malnutrition represents a key challenge for the global nutrition community. Without commitment, the policies, programs, and resources needed to improve nutrition are unlikely to be adopted, effectively implemented, nor sustained. One essential driver of commitment is nutrition actor network (NAN) effectiveness, the web of individuals and organizations operating within a given country who share a common interest in improving nutrition and who act collectively to do so. To inform new thinking and action towards strengthening NAN effectiveness, we use a systems dynamics theoretical approach and literature review to build initial causal loop diagrams (CLDs) of political commitment and NAN effectiveness and a qualitative group model building (GMB) method involving an expert workshop to strengthen model validity. First, a ``nutrition commitment system'' CLD demonstrates how five interrelated forms of commitment-rhetorical, institutional, operational, embedded, and system-wide-can dynamically reinforce or diminish one another over time. Second, we present CLDs demonstrating factors shaping NAN effectiveness organized into three categories: actor features, resources, and capacities; framing strategies, evidence, and norms; and institutional, political, and societal contexts. Together, these models generate hypotheses on how political commitment and NAN effectiveness could be strengthened in future and may provide potential starting points for country-specific conversations for doing so.",

title="Integrated Approach to Facilitate Stakeholder Participation in the Control of Endemic Diseases of Livestock: The Case of Peste Des Petits Ruminants in Mali",
journal="Frontiers in Veterinary Science",
year="2019",
volume="6",
pages="392",
abstract="In Mali, small ruminants (SRs) are an important means for enhanced livelihood through income generation, especially for women and youth. Unfortunately, opportunities for livestock farmers to tap into these resources for economic growth are hindered by high burden of endemic diseases such as peste des petits ruminants (PPR). A key component for the control of PPR is vaccination of SRs. However, low participation of farmers to vaccination was identified by stakeholders of the livestock value chains as a key constraint to successful vaccination programs. This study was implemented in the framework of a project which aimed at improving the domestic ruminant livestock value chains in Mali by upscaling proven interventions in animal health, feeds and feeding and livestock marketing. The objectives of the study were to review the context of livestock vaccination in Mali and evaluate the impact of innovation platforms (IP) as a means for engaging stakeholders in the vaccination process. Desk review, key informant interviews (KII) and net-mapping were used to understand the context of livestock vaccination, while vaccination coverage and sero-monitoring together with group interviews were used to measure the impact of the intervention. IPs were created in 24 communes in three regions: 15 IPs in Sikasso, 4 IPs in Mopti and 5 IPs in Timbuktu. They developed work plans and implemented activities focusing on improving interaction among key vaccine chain delivery stakeholders such as farmers, private veterinarians, vaccine manufacturers, local leaders and public veterinary services; involving them in the planning, implementation and evaluation of vaccination programs and fostering knowledge sharing, communication and capacity building. After 2 years of implementation of IPs, vaccination coverage for SRs increased significantly in target communes. During the first year, seroprevalence rate for PPR increased from 57{\%} (CI95: 54-60{\%}) at baseline to 70{\%} (CI95: 67-73{\%}) post-vaccination in Sikasso region, while in Mopti region, seroprevalence increased from 51{\%} (CI95: 47-55{\%}) at baseline to 57{\%} (CI85: 53-61{\%}) post-vaccination. Stakeholder engagement in the vaccination process through facilitated IPs was successful in fostering participation of farmers to vaccination. However, a sustainable vaccination strategy for Mali would benefit from consolidating the IP model, supported by Government investment to strengthen and adjust the underlying public-private-partnership.",

abstract="Many children globally do not meet government guidelines for daily fruit and vegetable intake, and in New Zealand, adherence to the vegetable intake recommendation is declining. This study aimed to identify systemic barriers to children meeting fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines and generate sustainable actions within a local community to improve children's FV intake. A qualitative system dynamics method of community group model building was used. The research team partnered with Healthy Families Waitakere, a Ministry of Health funded prevention initiative, to recruit 17 participants (including students, parents, teachers, community leaders, local retailers and health promoters) from a low-income, ethnically-diverse community in West Auckland, New Zealand. Three group model building workshops were held during which a systems map was created and used to identify actions by considering causal pathways and reinforcing loops in the system. Barriers to children's FV intake identified by participants were the saturation of fast-food outlets in the community and ubiquitous marketing of these products, the high cost of fresh produce compared to fast food, and parents having little time for food preparation plus declining cooking skills and knowledge. Several actions to improve children's FV intake by improving the local food environment were identified, which will be co-designed further and tested by a collaborative group involving community leaders. This project highlights the effectiveness of group model building for engaging a local community in systems change to improve child nutrition, and supplies a blueprint for future qualitative system dynamics research.",

abstract="Health system resilience reflects the ability to continue service delivery in the face of extraordinary shocks. We examined the case of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and its delivery of services to Palestine refugees in Syria during the ongoing crisis to identify factors enabling system resilience. The study is a retrospective qualitative case study utilizing diverse methods. We conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with UNRWA clinical and administrative professionals engaged in health service delivery over the period of the Syria conflict. Through a group model building session with a sub-group of eight of these participants, we then elicited a causal loop diagram of health system functioning over the course of the war, identifying pathways of threat and mitigating resilience strategies. We triangulated analysis with data from UNRWA annual reports and routine health management information. The UNRWA health system generally sustained service provision despite individual, community and system challenges that arose during the conflict. We distinguish absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities of the system facilitating this resilience. Absorptive capacities enabled immediate crisis response, drawing on available human and organizational resources. Adaptive capacities sustained service delivery through revised logistical arrangements, enhanced collaborative mechanisms and organizational flexibility. Transformative capacity was evidenced by the creation of new services in response to changing community needs. Analysis suggests factors such as staff commitment, organizational flexibility and availability of collaboration mechanisms were important assets in maintaining service continuity and quality. This evidence regarding alternative strategies adopted to sustain service delivery in Syria is of clear relevance to other actors seeking organizational resilience in crisis contexts.",

journal="Scientific Reports",
year="2019",

pages="12599",
abstract="Community-based systems interventions represent a promising, but complex approach to the prevention of childhood obesity. Existing studies suggest that the implementation of multiple actions by engaged community leaders (steering committees) is of critical importance to influence a complex system. This study explores two key components of systems interventions: (1) steering committees; and (2) causal loop diagrams (CLDs), used to map the complex community-level drivers of obesity. The interactions between two components create an entangled, complex process difficult to measure, and methods to analyse the dependencies between these two components in community-based systems interventions are limited. This study employs multilevel statistical models from social network analysis to explore the complex interdependencies between steering committee collaboration and their actions in the CLD. Steering committee members from two communities engaged in obesity prevention interventions reported on their collaborative relationships with each other, and where their actions are situated in a locally developed CLD. A multilevel exponential random graph model (MERGM) was developed for each community to explore the structural configurations of the collaboration network, actions in the CLD, and cross-level interactions. The models showed the tendency for reciprocated and transitive collaboration among committee members, as well as some evidence of more complex multilevel configurations that may indicate integrated solutions and collective action. The use of multilevel network analysis represents a step toward unpacking the complexities inherent in community-based systems interventions for obesity prevention.",

We engaged a diverse group of chain and local food outlet owners, residents, neighborhood organizations, and city agencies based in Baltimore, MD. Eighteen participants completed a series of exercises based on a set of pre-defined scripts through an interactive, iterative group model building process over a two-day community-based workshop. This process culminated in the development of causal loop diagrams, based on participants' perspectives, illustrating the dynamic factors in an urban neighborhood food system. Synthesis of diagrams yielded 21 factors and their embedded feedback loops. Crime played a prominent role in several feedback loops within the neighborhood food system: contributing to healthy food being ``risky food,'' supporting unhealthy food stores, and severing social ties important for learning about healthy food. Findings shed light on a new framework for thinking about barriers related to healthy food access and pointed to potential new avenues for intervention, such as reducing neighborhood crime.",

volume="17",
pages="17",
abstract="OBJECTIVES: To provide a specific example of how systems dynamics tools can increase understanding of stakeholder 'mental models' and generate robust systems-based hypotheses about the escalating problem of rising pedestrian death rates in the USA. METHODS: We designed and facilitated two group model building (GMB) workshops. Participants generated causal loop diagrams (CLDs) individually and in small groups to explore hypotheses concerning time-dynamic interacting factors underlying the increasing rates of pedestrian deaths. Using a grounded theory approach, research team members synthesised the structures and hypotheses into a single CLD. RESULTS: CLDs from the 41 participants indicated four core factors hypothesised to have a direct impact on pedestrian fatalities: pedestrian-vehicle crashes, vehicle speed at the time of the crash, vehicle size/dimensions and emergency response time. Participants diagrammed how actions and reactions impacted these proximal factors over time and led to ripple effects throughout a larger system to generate an increase in pedestrian deaths. Hypothesised contributing mechanisms fell within the following broad categories: community responses; research, policy and industry influence; potential unintended consequences of responses to pedestrian deaths; and the role of sprawl. CONCLUSIONS: This application of systems science tools suggested several strategies for advancing injury prevention research and practice. The project generated robust hypotheses and advanced stakeholder communication and depth of understanding and engagement in this key issue. The CLD and GMB process detailed in this study provides a concrete example of how systems tools can be adopted and applied to a transportation safety topic.",

abstract="OBJECTIVES: To generate system insights on patient and provider levers and strategies that must be activated to improve hospital-based smoking cessation treatment. DESIGN: Mixed methods study including a series of in-depth group model building sessions, which informed the design of an online survey completed by healthcare providers and a structured interview protocol administered at the bedside to patients who smoke. SETTING: Large, tertiary care hospital in the Midwestern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Group model building: 28 healthcare providers and 22 previously-hospitalised patients; Online survey: 308 healthcare providers; Bedside interviews: 205 hospitalised patients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypothesis-generating, participatory qualitative methods informed the examination of the following quantitative outcomes: patient interest versus provider perception of patient interest in smoking cessation and treatment; patient-reported receipt versus provider-reported offering of inpatient smoking cessation interventions; and priority ratings of importance and feasibility of strategies to improve treatment. RESULTS: System insights included patients frequently leaving the floor to smoke, which created major workflow disruption. Leverage points included interventions to reduce withdrawal symptoms, and action ideas included nurse-driven protocols for timely administration of nicotine replacement therapy. Quantitative data corroborated system insights; for instance, 80{\%} of providers reported that patients frequently leave the floor to smoke, leading to safety risks, missed assessments and inefficient use of staff time. Patients reported significantly lower rates of receiving any smoking cessation interventions, compared with provider reports (mean difference=17.4{\%}-33.7{\%}, p<0.001). Although 92{\%} of providers cited patient interest as a key barrier, only 4{\%} of patients indicated no interest in quitting or reducing smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging hospital providers and patients in participatory approaches to develop an implementation strategy revealed discrepant perceptions of patient interest and frequency of hospital-based treatment for smoking. These findings spurred adoption of standardised point-of-care treatment for cigarette smoking, which remains highly prevalent yet undertreated among hospitalised patients.",

abstract="Time-limited prevention initiatives are frequently used to address complex and persisting public health issues, such as non-communicable diseases. This often creates issues in terms of achieving sustainable change. In this study, we use a system dynamic perspective to explore the effects of stop-start funding over system behaviour in two community-based initiatives designed to prevent chronic diseases and obesity. We conducted a qualitative exploratory study using complexity theory as an analytical lens of two Healthy Together Communities (HTCs) initiatives in Victoria, Australia. Data were generated from 20 semi-structured interviews with health promotion practitioners and managers, from community health and local government organizations. Template analysis based on properties of complex systems informed the inductive identification of system behaviour narratives across the stop-start life-course of HTCs. A central narrative of system behaviour emerged around relationships. Within it, we identified pre-existing contextual conditions and intervention design elements that influenced non-linearity of system self-organization and adaptation, and emergence of outcomes. Examples include cynicism, personal relationships and trust, and history of collaboration. Feedback loops operated between HTCs and these conditions, in a way that could influence long-term system behaviour. Taking a dynamic life-course view of system behaviour helps understand the pre-existing contextual factors, design and implementation influences, and feedback loops which shape the long-term legacy of short-lived interventions aimed at solving complex issues. In turn, greater awareness of such interactions can inform better design and implementation of community-based interventions.",

pages="1420",
abstract="BACKGROUND: Understanding levels of community readiness can result in prevention efforts that align with communities' ability and capacity for change and, therefore, be more effective and sustainable. Our study aimed to use baseline (pre-intervention) community readiness scores to assist with the development of obesity prevention strategies, and to assess changes in community readiness over time (pre/post- intervention), to provide evidence of intervention impact. METHOD: Our study was located in a rural and remote area of Victoria, Australia. Community readiness was part of a broader obesity prevention intervention designed to create healthier food and physical activity environments through the combination of systems thinking and collaborative community-led solutions. Interviews were conducted using the community readiness to change tool in 2016 (pre) and 2018 (post) with a community representative sample. Baseline data informed the development of community relevant strategies and the pre/post results formed part of the overall evaluation. RESULTS: The tool generated both quantitative and qualitative (quotes) data. A final readiness score was calculated that corresponded to one of the nine stages of readiness. Four of the five domains of the community readiness to change tool showed statistically significant improvements over time (p < 0.05): knowledge of effort, knowledge of issue, community climate, and leadership. The resources domain that did not improve pre/post intervention. CONCLUSION: Community readiness to change interviews, pre- and post- intervention, provided essential information related to the appropriate targeting and pitch of the prevention strategies, as well as providing an overall evaluation of the positive movement in the community's readiness to implement change.",

journal="Global Health Promotion",
year="2019",
volume="26",
number="3",
pages="32-40",
abstract="INTRODUCTION: Facilitating processes for coordinated action in the field of health promotion is a challenge. Poorthuis and Bijl's (2006) Participatory Network Mapping Tool (PNMT) uses visualization and discussion to map the positions and roles of network actors, stimulate learning processes, and elicit actionable knowledge. This article describes the results from the application of the PNMT in networks of two Dutch health promotion programmes (Health Race and BeweegKuur) with the aim of determining the value of the PNMT to partners in health promotions networks. METHODS: A qualitative secondary analysis (QSA) was conducted to clarify positions and roles, learning processes, and actionable knowledge of network actors in existing data sets including five group interviews of the Health Race programme and 16 individual interviews and 15 group interviews of the BeweegKuur programme. RESULTS: The PNMT maps both positions and roles of (missing) actors and makes successes (e.g. knowing each other) and challenges (e.g. implementing new activities) visible. Thus, the PNMT provides a starting point for discussion and reflection and eliciting actionable knowledge such as involving new actors and target populations in the programme. CONCLUSION: The PNMT contributes to the facilitation of coordinated action in health promotion networks by making positions and roles of network partners visible. In combination with dialogue and reflection the PNMT helps to elucidate factors influencing coordinated action and outcomes. The PNMT is valuable in grasping intangible aspects between actors by stimulating collective learning. These insights can be used by researchers and network actors to achieve more successful coordinated action for health promotion.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Group model building (GMB) is an approach to building qualitative and quantitative models with stakeholders to learn about the interrelationships among multilevel factors causing complex public health problems over time. Scant literature exists on adapting this method to address public health issues that involve racial dynamics. OBJECTIVES: This study's objectives are to (1) introduce GMB methods, (2) present a framework for adapting GMB to enhance cultural responsiveness, and (3) describe outcomes of adapting GMB to incorporate differences in racial socialization during a community project seeking to understand key determinants of community violence transmission. METHODS: An academic-community partnership planned a 1-day session with diverse stakeholders to explore the issue of violence using GMB. We documented key questions inspired by critical race theory (CRT) and adaptations to established GMB ``scripts'' (i.e., published facilitation instructions). The theory's emphasis on experiential knowledge led to a narrative-based facilitation guide from which participants created causal loop diagrams. These early diagrams depict how violence is transmitted and how communities respond, based on participants' lived experiences and mental models of causation that grew to include factors associated with race. CONCLUSIONS: Participants found these methods useful for advancing difficult discussion. The resulting diagrams can be tested and expanded in future research, and will form the foundation for collaborative identification of solutions to build community resilience. GMB is a promising strategy that community partnerships should consider when addressing complex health issues; our experience adapting methods based on CRT is promising in its acceptability and early system insights.",

pages="igx018",
abstract="Gerontologists have argued that the growing human capital of the aging population can be better marshaled as a resource for families, communities, and society at large. Additionally, this active, purposeful engagement can produce positive outcomes for older adults themselves. In this manuscript, we propose that existing conceptual frameworks articulating antecedents and outcomes of productive engagement, including working, volunteering, and caregiving can be improved using a system dynamics (SD) approach. Through a series of five unstructured group model-building sessions, experts from gerontology and systems science developed a qualitative SD model of the productive engagement of older adults. The model illustrates the reciprocal and dynamic nature of the stocks of human capital of older adults, social capital of older adults, and family resources; the engagement of older adults in productive activities; and the social and organizational variables that affect the flow and depletion of these stocks. Given this is the first attempt to develop a SD model for productive engagement in later life, the model is preliminary and heuristic. However, it offers a new approach to advancing theory and research on productive engagement in later life. Further, it can guide the development of mathematical models to estimate the effects of changes in any part of this system.",

pages="3363-3376",
abstract="AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers and supporting factors for breastfeeding, and the dynamic interactions between them, as identified by low-income African American women and lactation peer helpers. BACKGROUND: Stark breastfeeding disparities exist between African American mothers and their White counterparts in the USA. This pattern is often replicated across the globe, with marginalised populations demonstrating decreased breastfeeding rates. While breastfeeding research focused on sociocultural factors for different populations has been conducted, a more dynamic model of the factors impacting breastfeeding may help identify effective leverage points for change. DESIGN: Group model building was used as a grounded theoretical approach, to build and validate a model representing factors impacting breastfeeding and the relationships between them. METHODS: Low-income African American women (n = 21) and lactation peer helpers (n = 3) were engaged in model building sessions to identify factors impacting breastfeeding. A two-cycle process was used for analysis, in vivo and axial coding. The final factors and model were validated with a subgroup of participants. RESULTS: The participants generated 82 factors that make breastfeeding easier, and 86 factors that make breastfeeding more challenging. These were grouped into 10 and 14 themes, respectively. A final model was constructed identifying three domains impacting breastfeeding: a mother's return to work or school, her knowledge, support and persistence, and the social acceptance of breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented the sociocultural context within which low-income African American women are situated by identifying factors impacting breastfeeding, and the dynamic interactions between them. The model also provided various leverage points from which breastfeeding women can be supported. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Postpartum nurses are critical in supporting breastfeeding practices. To be most effective, they must be aware of the factors impacting breastfeeding, some of which may be unique to women based on their culture.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Community partnerships to promote healthy eating and active living in order to prevent childhood obesity face a number of challenges. Systems science tools combined with group model-building techniques offer promising methods that use transdisciplinary team-based approaches to improve understanding of the complexity of the obesity epidemic. This article presents evaluation methods and findings from 49 Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities sites funded to implement policy, system, and environmental changes from 2008 to 2014. METHODS: Through half-day group model-building sessions conducted as part of evaluation site visits to each community between 2010 and 2013, a total of 50 causal loop diagrams were produced for 49 communities (1 community had 2 causal loop diagrams representing different geographic regions). The analysis focused on the following evaluation questions: (1) What were the most prominent variables in the causal loop diagrams across communities? (2) What were the major feedback structures across communities? (3) What implications from the synthesized causal loop diagram can be translated to policy makers, practitioners, evaluators, funders, and other community representatives? RESULTS: A total of 590 individuals participated with an average of 12 participants per session. Participants' causal loop diagrams included a total of 227 unique variables in the following major subsystems: healthy eating policies and environments, active living policies and environments, health and health behaviors, partnership and community capacity, and social determinants. In a synthesized causal loop diagram representing variables identified by at least 20{\%} of the communities, many feedback structures emerged and several themes are highlighted with respect to implications for policy and practice as well as assessment and evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The application of systems thinking tools combined with group model-building techniques creates opportunities to define and characterize complex systems in a manner that draws on the authentic voice of residents and community partners.",

Evaluators designed a mixed-methods evaluation to capture the complexity of the HKHC projects, understand implementation, and document perceived and actual impacts of these efforts. Eight complementary evaluation methods addressed 4 primary aims seeking to (1) coordinate data collection for the evaluation through the web-based project management system (HKHC Community Dashboard) and provide training and technical assistance for use of this system; (2) guide data collection and analysis through use of the Assessment and Evaluation Toolkit; (3) conduct a quantitative cross-site impact evaluation among a subset of community partnership sites; and (4) conduct a qualitative cross-site process and impact evaluation among all 49 community partnership sites. Evaluators identified successes and challenges in relation to the following methods: an online performance-monitoring HKHC Community Dashboard system, environmental audits, direct observations, individual and group interviews, partnership and community capacity surveys, group model building, photographs and videos, and secondary data sources (surveillance data and record review). Several themes emerged, including the value of systems approaches, the need for capacity building for evaluation, the value of focusing on upstream and downstream outcomes, and the importance of practical approaches for dissemination. The mixed-methods evaluation of HKHC advances evaluation science related to community-based efforts for addressing childhood obesity in complex community settings. The findings are likely to provide practice-relevant evidence for public health.",

Successfully addressing peak energy concerns requires understanding of all the factors that affect electricity demand especially at peak times. This paper is based on past attempts of proposing models designed to aid our understanding of the influences on residential peak energy demand in a systematic and comprehensive way. Our model has been developed through a group model building process as a systems framework of the problem situation to model the complexity within and between systems and indicate how changes in one element might flow on to others. It is comprised of themes (social, technical and change management options) networked together in a way that captures their influence and association with each other and also their influence, association and impact on appliance usage and residential peak energy demand. The real value of the model is in creating awareness, understanding and insight into the complexity of residential peak energy demand and in working with this complexity to identify and integrate the social, technical and change management option themes and their impact on appliance usage and residential energy demand at peak times.",

abstract="The wetland system possesses diverse functions such as preserving water sources, mediating flooding, providing habitats for wildlife and stabilizing coastlines. Nonetheless, rapid economic growth and the increasing population have significantly deteriorated the wetland environment. To secure the sustainability of the wetland, it is essential to introduce integrated and systematic management. This paper examines the resource management of the Jiading Wetland by applying group model building (GMB) and system dynamics (SD). We systematically identify local stakeholders' mental model regarding the impact brought by the yacht industry, and further establish a SD model to simulate the dynamic wetland environment. The GMB process improves the stakeholders' understanding about the interaction between the wetland environment and management policies. Differences between the stakeholders' perceptions and the behaviors shown by the SD model also suggest that our analysis would facilitate the stakeholders to broaden their horizons and achieve consensus on the wetland resource management.",

abstract="The management of occupational health and safety (OHS) including safety culture interventions is comprised of complex problems that are often hard to scope and define. Due to the dynamic nature and complexity of OHS management, the concept of system dynamics (SD) is used to analyze accident prevention. In this paper, a system dynamics group model building (GMB) approach is used to create a causal loop diagram of the underlying factors influencing the OHS performance of a major drilling and mining contractor in Australia. While the organization has invested considerable resources into OHS their disabling injury frequency rate (DIFR) has not been decreasing. With this in mind, rich individualistic knowledge about the dynamics influencing the DIFR was acquired from experienced employees with operations, health and safety and training background using a GMB workshop. Findings derived from the workshop were used to develop a series of causal loop diagrams that includes a wide range of dynamics that can assist in better understanding the causal influences OHS performance. The causal loop diagram provides a tool for organizations to hypothesize the dynamics influencing effectiveness of OHS management, particularly the impact on DIFR. In addition the paper demonstrates that the SD GMB approach has significant potential in understanding and improving OHS management.",

journal="Journal of Public Health Management {\&} Practice",
year="2015",
volume="21 Suppl 3",
pages="S45-54",
abstract="CONTEXT: In the evaluation of the Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities initiative, investigators implemented Group Model Building (GMB) to promote systems thinking at the community level. As part of the GMB sessions held in each community partnership, participants created behavior-over-time graphs (BOTGs) to characterize their perceptions of changes over time related to policies, environments, collaborations, and social determinants in their community related to healthy eating, active living, and childhood obesity. OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of coding BOTGs and their trends. DESIGN: Descriptive study of trends among BOTGs from 11 domains (eg, active living environments, social determinants of health, funding) and relevant categories and subcategories based on the graphed variables. In addition, BOTGs were distinguished by whether the variables were positively (eg, access to healthy foods) or negatively (eg, screen time) associated with health. SETTING: The GMB sessions were held in 49 community partnerships across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the GMB sessions (n = 590; n = 5-21 per session) included key individuals engaged in or impacted by the policy, system, or environmental changes occurring in the community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirty codes were developed to describe the direction (increasing, decreasing, stable) and shape (linear, reinforcing, balancing, or oscillating) of trends from 1660 graphs. RESULTS: The patterns of trends varied by domain. For example, among variables positively associated with health, the prevalence of reinforcing increasing trends was highest for active living and healthy eating environments (37.4{\%} and 29.3{\%}, respectively), partnership and community capacity (38.8{\%}), and policies (30.2{\%}). Examination of trends of specific variables suggested both convergence (eg, for cost of healthy foods) and divergence (eg, for farmers' markets) of trends across partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Behavior-over-time graphs provide a unique data source for understanding community-level trends and, when combined with causal maps and computer modeling, can yield insights about prevention strategies to address childhood obesity.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Healthy Kids, Healthy Cuba (HKHCuba) is 1 of 49 community partnerships that participated in the national Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. One method of evaluation was to introduce systems thinking at the community level by identifying the essential parts of the HKHCuba system and how it influences policy and environmental changes to promote healthy eating and active living as well as to prevent childhood obesity in this unique, triethnic, rural community in New Mexico. METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 12 HKHCuba partners participated in a group model building (GMB) session to develop behavior over time graphs and a causal loop diagram. RESULTS: Twenty-seven influences identified in the behavior over time graphs emerged as feedback loops and 5 subsystems emerged within the causal loop diagram. In addition to specific strategy-related influences (eg, access to healthy food, participation in community gardens), sense of cultural pride, sense of community, and social engagement, particularly among youth, were highly salient topics. CONCLUSIONS: The GMB process provided participants with the opportunity to explore the connections across their specific areas of work and make connections between policy and environmental influences on healthy eating and active living behaviors. The GMB processes and systems thinking approaches were new to the majority of participants, received positively, and perhaps should have been introduced earlier in the project period.",

pages="S84-7",
abstract="BACKGROUND: In 2010, Denver Public Health at Denver Health was awarded a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities (HKHC) grant that supported policy, system, and environmental changes to expand healthy food access through gardens and large-chain grocery stores and expand environments that are safe for all children to play, walk, and bike. Systems-thinking approaches enhanced the Denver partnership's work to identify and address the multiple and complex factors affecting the environment changes implemented to increase active living and healthy eating. Continued application of the systems-thinking approach in Denver will sustain outcomes for obesity prevention efforts beyond the grant project cycle, specifically in park space redevelopment. METHODS: Key members of the Denver HKHC coalition were invited to participate in a half-day group model-building workshop to create behavior-over-time graphs and a causal loop diagram. These activities were intended to build on the Denver HKHC partnership's work by identifying factors that affect or are affected by policy, system, and environmental changes that influence active living, healthy eating or childhood obesity. RESULTS: Environments (ie, park space, farms, gardens) developed or renovated should consider identifying and addressing a range of factors that may influence access and utilization of active living and healthy eating. CONCLUSIONS: Denver's partnership found the experience highly valuable for identifying the policy, system, and environment change pathways that lead to increases in active living and healthy food access. In addition, it highlighted the need to identify and address the multiple and complex change pathways to ensure the outcomes of environment change, especially with park space, implemented in Denver achieve increased access to active living and healthy eating.",

number="5",
pages="416-23",
abstract="Despite progress over the past decade in reducing the global burden of newborn deaths, gaps in the knowledge base persist, and means of translating empirical findings into effective policies and programs that deliver life-saving interventions remain poorly understood. Articles in this issue highlight the relevance of transdisciplinary research in perinatology and calls for increased efforts to translate research into public policy and to integrate interventions into existing primary care delivery systems. Given the complexity and multi-causality of many of the remaining challenges in newborn health, and the effects that social and economic factors have over many newborn conditions, it has further been proposed that integrated, multi-sector public policies are also required. In this article, we discuss the application of systems science methods to advance transdisciplinary research and public policy-making in perinatology. Such approaches to research and public policy have been used to address various global challenges but have rarely been implemented in developing country settings. We propose that they hold great promise to improve not only our understanding of complex perinatology problems but can also help translate research-based insights into effective, multi-pronged solutions that deliver positive, intended effects. Examples of successful transdisciplinary science exist, but successes and failures are context specific, and there are no universal blueprints or formulae to reproduce what works in a specific context into different social system settings. Group model building is a tool, based in the field of System Dynamics, that we have used to facilitate transdisciplinary research and, to a lesser extent, policy formulation in a systematic and replicable way. In this article, we describe how group model building can be used and argue for scaling its use to further the translation of empirical evidence and insights into policy and action that increase maternal and neonatal survival and well-being.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Youth violence in general and gang violence in particular continues to be a pernicious problem facing the majority of large U.S. cities. Attempts to reduce youth violence are hindered by the absence of a shared framework that crosses multiple disciplines. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Youth Violence Systems Project (YVSP) is to help communities strategize for and achieve sustained reductions in youth violence in Boston. METHODS: A distinction of YVSP is the engagement of community residents in a group model building process to develop a conceptual framework and create a system dynamics computer model of youth violence in Boston. Community residents including youth participated in the design, execution, and evaluation of the project. We also partnered with community agencies to gain insight from individuals with a history of gang involvement or violent offense. The computer model highlights the dynamics of movement into and out of gangs, and the relationships that influence violent interactions among individuals and gangs. The model serves as a simulation-based laboratory for examining initiatives aimed at reducing youth violence within a community. It considers the positive feedback between traumatic stress and violence; as violence levels rise in the community, this increases individual traumatic stress, which further increases violent responses by community members. CONCLUSION: The project's community-based approach coupled with its system dynamics methodology produced a new understanding of youth violence in Boston. This understanding undergirds the model's logic, making it more useful to community residents and more accurate in describing the behavior of youth in high-violence neighborhoods.",

abstract="This paper describes a Group Model Building (GMB) initiative that was designed to discuss the various potential effects that an offshore wind-farm may have on its local ecology and socioeconomic development. The representatives of various organizations in the study area, Lu-Kang, Taiwan, have held several meetings, and structured debates have been organized to promote the emergence of a consensual view on the main issues and their implications. A System Dynamics (SD) model has been built and corrected iteratively with the participants through the GMB process. The diverse interests within the group led the process toward the design of multifunctional wind-farms with different modalities. The scenario analyses, using the SD model under various policies, including no wind-farm policy, objectively articulates the vision of the local stakeholders. The results of the SD simulations show that the multifunctional wind-farms may have superior economic effects and the larger wind-farms with bird corridors could reduce ecological impact. However, the participants of the modeling process did not appreciate any type of offshore wind-farm development when considering all of the identified key factors of social acceptance. The insight gained from the study can provide valuable information to actualize feasible strategies for the green energy technique to meet local expectations.",

abstract="This article describes the use of group model building to facilitate interaction with stakeholders, synthesize research results and assist in the development of hypotheses about climate change at the global level in relation to UV-B radiation and ecosystem service valuation. The objective was to provide a platform for integration of the various research components within a multidisciplinary research project as a basis for interaction with stakeholders with backgrounds in areas other than science. An integrated summary of the scientific findings, along with stakeholder input, was intended to produce a bridge between science and policymaking. We used a mediated modeling approach that was implemented as a pilot project in Ushuaia, Argentina. The investigation was divided into two participatory workshops: data gathering and model evaluation. Scientists and the local stakeholders supported the valuation of ecosystem services as a useful common denominator for integrating the various scientific results. The concept of economic impacts in aquatic and marsh systems was represented by values for ecosystem services altered by UV-B radiation. In addition, direct local socioeconomic impacts of enhanced UV-B radiation were modeled, using data from Ushuaia. We worked with 5 global latitudinal regions, focusing on net primary production and biomass for the marine system and on 3 plant species for the marsh system. Ecosystem service values were calculated for both sectors. The synthesis model reflects the conclusions from the literature and from experimental research at the global level. UV-B is not a significant stress for the marshes, relative to the potential impact of increases in the sea level. Enhanced UV-B favors microbial dynamics in marine systems that could cause a significant shift from primary producers to bacteria at the community level. In addition, synergetic effects of UV-B and certain pollutants potentiate the shift to heterotrophs. This may impact the oceanic carbon cycle by increasing the ratio of respiratory to photosynthetic organisms in surface waters and, thus, the role of the ocean as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2. In summary, although changes in the marine sector due to anthropogenic influences may affect global climate change, marshes are expected to primarily be affected by climate change.",

This study provides an innovative framework for examining the communication trends and perceived sociopolitical benefits for adolescents engaging diverse groups in a youth-led social-justice-oriented SNS. The author linked three school-based youth participatory action research projects involving 54 high school students through an SNS.

abstract="How do individuals discover the feedback structure of a situation? Does such knowledge help people design and select better decisions? Do decision aids such as causal loop diagrams help? These questions have so far received limited research attention in controlled studies in system dynamics. Here we test the effectiveness of different methods commonly used in group decision settings such as group model building workshops. We employed a hidden profile experimental design in which each individual in a group possessed private information that must be shared to arrive at a good solution-in this case, policies to improve performance. The task placed participants in the role of a manager in a department at the Saturday Evening Post. Processing of department-specific information will be needed to discover the full feedback structure. We compare decision quality and structural understanding across four conditions: (i) a control setting in which participants only receive minutes of a meeting; (ii) a setting in which participants are actively engaged in qualitative modeling (developing a causal loop diagram); (iii) a setting in which participants receive a causal loop diagram as a decision aid; and (iv) setting (iii) but with all participants given full information. Model use had no effect on the importance participants attached to critical information, understanding of model structure, or confidence in their decisions. However, for participants actively engaged in modeling, we found a substantial correlation between importance attached to critical information, understanding, and confidence. The results have implications for group model building research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

abstract="Persistent challenges to public health and well-being are being addressed though complex interventions. Complex interventions are intentional processes designed to shift and realign the form and function of targeted system patterns by changing underlying system dynamics, structures, and conditions. The IM40 initiative was a complex health promotion intervention designed to address adolescent health and well-being through a developmental assets approach. The initiative sought to influence several levels simultaneously (e.g. individual, professional, procedural, and policy), compounding the complexity for implementation and evaluation. The purpose of this case study is to present the development and initiation of an evaluation approach based on systems thinking and complexity science principles, concepts, and methods. We used three systems methods, Group Model Building (GMB), viable systems model (VSM) assessment, and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify and examine underlying patterns and structures that influenced system-wide behaviors. Each method focused on a general systems-oriented question and illuminated stakeholder views of the IM40 theory of change, adaptive organization of multiple independent institutions, and relational ties among system actors. Collectively, the methods enabled us to describe systems change over time and examine shifts in boundaries, relationships, perspectives, and dynamics. The implications of this approach relative to typical evaluation activities in public health practice are contrasted and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

We then suggest a set of metrics to analyze the matrices. We apply our method to a dataset of three GMB processes, finding the suggested method to be helpful for evaluating the extent to which all participants were able to include their perspectives, and whether new ideas emerged from the process, thus constituting innovation. We conclude that our method may be a valuable contribution to the evaluation of GMB processes.

The problems are made even more difficult when much of the information available is qualitative, not quantitative. In order to reduce endless complexities and produce manageable simplicities, the study proposes a workable systems methodology and a holistic frame of reference that allows managers to focus on relevant issues and avoid the endless search for more details, while drowning in proliferating useless information. This paper presents two cases illustrating systems approaches to marketing strategy and decision-making.

The intent of the author is to begin with a sequence of simulatable pictures so simple and self explanatory, in the domain and language of the group's problem, that the group is quickly and naturally drawn into the system dynamics approach. The author presents two examples in detail, illustrating a range of possibilities, and describes in detail the assumptions behind the idea of concept models, some design principles that have matured over time as our experience has grown, and a discussion of possible problems with the approach. The concept models used in the welfare reform group modeling sessions were very simple, starting with just two stocks and ending up eventually with just three stocks and three flows. Creating such a compelling sequence of concept models as this one with no more than three stocks gets the conversation off to an informed and highly motivated start with a minimum chance of confusing or losing people. The models are tiny and the models are constructed and sequenced to get across very particular aspects of the system dynamics approach, including the idea that dynamic behavior is a consequence of system structure. Concept models should have simple, even obvious, algebraic structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

abstract="Social learning among different stakeholders is often a goal in problem solving contexts such as environmental management. Participatory methods (e.g., group model-building and role playing games) are frequently assumed to stimulate social learning. Yet understanding if and why this assumption is justified is quite limited. Difficulties arise from the complexity and context-dependence of processes influencing social learning. Furthermore, continuing discussion of the exact meaning and theoretical basis of social learning result in a limited capacity to assess and evaluate whether social learning has occurred. In this paper we introduce an analytical framework to develop an in depth understanding of essential processes underlying social learning facilitated by participatory methods. Concepts from different fields of science are discussed and integrated, including resource management, small group research and learning research. The individual and group perspectives are brought together via mental models and emergent roles. We added the direction of learning, being either convergent or divergent, to be able to explore if and when personal views on a problem converge into a shared understanding of a problem. The analysis of convergence and divergence of learning is facilitated through the use of the mental model concept. Methods for measurement of proposed indicators for social learning are also discussed. The framework developed provides a conceptual basis for the analysis of social learning facilitated by participatory methods and an operationalization for application in empirical research.

Separate group model building workshops were held with the apprentices, tradesmen, management and external stakeholders. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) were developed for each stakeholder group and the three internal stakeholder group CLDs were merged for further analysis.

This process serves to link event thinking to structural thinking. These guidelines were used in a case, which involved: (1) developing a cause model of scenarios of the promotion of renewable energy sources in the U.K. electric power market from material elicited from a client group; (2) creating a system dynamics model of the same area; and (3) an integration of products 1 and 2 which enabled an analysis of the scenarios using the simulation model. The first two products used standard approaches and are not new; however, the third represents the key output of the research. By linking products 1 and 2, the research aimed to create better client value in the project by combining, in a systematic way, the relevant elements of scenario maps and system dynamics models. The process allows client groups to visualize and comprehend the linkage between event thinking and structural thinking in a complex system.

abstract="In the face of complex and uncertain issues, one important goal of public participation in resource management and research is to foster communication and the inclusion of non-expert knowledge-thus the effective flow of information between project organisers and stakeholders. We compare different methods (instruments, tools) that were employed in the German-Austrian 'PartizipA' project to structure information flows in participatory processes. Depending on their goals and context, more or less 'formalised' and 'participatory' methods were applied, the most important being guided interviews, focus groups, agent-based modelling, nutrient modelling, cognitive mapping and group model building as well as the development of a common document. Two regional case studies, both concerned with European-induced institutional change, are portrayed in which the specific participatory methods were embedded. The Austrian case study involved the analysis and modelling of agricultural land use in the region of St. Polten against the background of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, while the implementation of recent European water policy was the issue in the German agricultural region north of Osnabruck. Presenting both cases in their regional context, the applied methods are first described according to the logic of the entire respective process. Subsequently, the specific methods are systematically analysed and compared according to their objective, context and degrees of participation and formalisation. Finally, we evaluate all methods regarding their effectiveness in terms of goal attainment and their potential generalisation, seeking to respond to the question of when a particular method might best be used.

The first full-day workshop was based around systems thinking methods using a group model-building approach. By the end of the workshop the group concluded that the issues were far too complex to be addressed satisfactorily with this approach. Complexity theory was proposed as a suitable way forward. The next two half-day workshops used complexity thinking methods to come up with a set of attractors and a shared mental model, which provided greater insights into the problem issues.

abstract="The key challenge for transdisciplinary research aiming to integrate social and scientific knowledge is to produce societal and scientific impacts at the same time. Participatory modelling is a method that uses models in three ways: as a means to generate knowledge, to achieve knowledge integration and to enable societal impact. Agent-based modelling is a computer simulation technique that allows for simulating different actors as agents, the socioeconomic and natural environment they are embedded in, and the interactions among agents and between agents and their environment. This paper presents projects developing agent-based models of Austrian regions with single farm households as agents. The models simulate how changes in socioeconomic and political conditions affect patterns of land use, agricultural production and the socioeconomic situation within this region. Farm households and their decision-making process with its ecological, economic and social implications represent the basis of the agent-based models. We discuss how and why participatory modelling can help foster the impact potentials of transdisciplinary research and what the limitations of the different types of models are. We show that participatory modelling allows for the integration of the most relevant issues in the models and for the development of scenarios and strategies together with the stakeholders. Participatory modelling shows its strength in structuring communication on future scenarios and recommendations for action towards reaching the targets of the various groups involved in transdisciplinary research. Stakeholders can use the model for effective discussion and education processes to find sustainable pathways in agricultural development.",

The Campbelltown - Changing our Future study will translate 'a whole of system' approach, previously trialed in rural communities in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territoty, to Campbelltown Local Government Area (LGA), a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse urban community in south western Sydney, NSW. METHODS: The study intervention will use a five-step approach; 1 - set up a childhood obesity monitoring system by collecting baseline data from children in primary schools across Campbelltown LGA to give a local context to the community when developing the systems map; 2 - key stakeholders develop systems maps which inform the development of the interventions; 3 - key stakeholders and community groups identify priority areas for action and form working groups; 4 - implementation of the interventions; 5 - evaluation of the interventions. The study will adopt a longitudinal pre/post design with repeated measures at baseline, 2{\thinspace}years and 4{\thinspace}years. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to collect and analyse the data. DISCUSSION: Addressing childhood overweight and obesity is complex and requires a multifaceted intervention. This approach has the capacity to impact a range of factors that influence childhood overweight and obesity utilising existing capacity of multiple partners with broad community reach. Findings will develop local responses which capture the complexity of obesity at a community level and further our understanding of the interrelationships and relative importance of local factors impacting childhood overweight and obesity. This study aims to provide evidence for systems methods and approaches suitable for adaption and scaling and may provide evidence of successful community intervention elements.",

abstract="Upcycling is a process in which used or waste products and materials are repaired, reused, repurposed, refurbished, upgraded and remanufactured in a creative way to add value to the compositional elements. It has been part of human life throughout history, and the past few years have seen its revival, driven by multiple factors including growing concern for the environment and resource scarcity. Upcycling increases quality and lifetimes of materials and products, reduces wastes, creates employment opportunities, and encourages sustainable consumer behaviour. Despite such benefits and increasing interest, upcycling is largely considered as a niche practice. One of the important gaps in the current state of knowledge on upcycling is a lack of systemic understanding about challenges and success factors relating to scaling up upcycling businesses. This paper aims to address this gap by employing a broad range of methods for reaching its goal, including literature review, stakeholder analysis, semi-structured interviews, group model building, development of causal loop diagrams, and a workshop with stakeholders and experts to validate causal loop diagrams and discuss promising interventions and how to proceed. The results identified potential actors for the success of upcycling businesses, key challenges and success factors, causal linkages among the challenges and success factors, key system mechanisms, and interventions for scaling up upcycling businesses. Collaboration across the upcycling value chain involving a wide range of actors is also discussed.",

abstract="Background In Kenya, Community Health Committees (CHC) were established to enhance community participation in health services. Their role is to provide leadership, oversight in delivery of community health services, promote social accountability and mobilize resources for community health. CHCs form social networks with other actors, with whom they exchange health information for decision-making and accountability. This case study aimed to explore the structure of a rural and an urban CHC network and to analyze how health-related information flowed in these networks. Understanding the pathways of information in community settings may provide recommendations for strategies to improve the role and functioning of CHCs. Methods In 2017, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 27 community discussants and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals in a rural area and an urban slum. Using social network analysis, we determined the structure of their social networks and how health related information flowed in these networks. Results Both CHCs were composed of respected persons nominated by their communities. Each social network had 12 actors that represented both community and government institutions. CHCs were not central actors in the exchange of health-related information. Health workers, community health volunteers and local Chiefs in the urban slum often passed information between the different groups of actors, while CHCs hardly did this. Therefore, CHCs had little control over the flow of health-related information. Although CHC members were respected persons who served in multiple roles within their communities, this did not enhance their centrality. It emerged that CHCs were often left out in the flow of health-related information and decision-making, which led to demotivation. Community health volunteers were more involved by other actors such as health managers and non-governmental organizations as a conduit for health-related information. Conclusion Social network analysis demonstrated how CHCs played a peripheral role in the flow of health-related information. Their perception of being left out of the information flow led to demotivation, which hampered their ability to facilitate community participation in community health services; hence challenging effective participation through CHCs.",

abstract="Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in the social, economic and environmental aspect is widely accepted although still represents a big challenge for its implementation in global, regional and local scales. This is particularly important in the situation of new investments. In the case of already existing hydro-technical facilities, which were built at the end of the nineties of the last century, water management takes into account only the ecological awareness for their design and social participation is limited to acceptance of the local community. The M{\'{s}}ciwoj{\'o}w retention reservoir analysed in the article is an example of an object whose project included ecological solutions aimed at ensuring high water quality, and its construction was approved and supported by the local community. At present, the reservoir does not function in accordance with the adopted assumptions, and water management requires the implementation of system solutions that take into account contradicting expectations of users and stakeholders of the reservoir. The current situation can be categorized as a wicked problem. The article presents a proposal to solve the situation on the basis of a participatory approach involving stakeholders through social learning as a part of the reservoir management system. The system approach was developed based on the principles of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and 10 Steps Planning Processing by Wilhite while using the causal loop diagrams (CLD). The result is an organizational model of the reservoir management structure and framework methodology for building solution scenarios. The key assumption of the proposed approach is the cyclicality of activities as part of the management process taking into account changes in the reservoir system and its settings in the social, economic and environmental aspects.",

Sustainable Childhood Obesity Prevention through Community Engagement (SCOPE) has implemented Live 5-2-1-0---a multi-sector, multi-component childhood obesity prevention initiative informed by systems thinking and participatory research via an innovative knowledge translation (KT) model (RE-FRAME). This paper describes the protocol for implementing and evaluating RE-FRAME in two `existing' (>2 years of implementation) and two `new' Live 5-2-1-0 communities to understand how to facilitate and sustain systems/community-level change. In this mixed-methods study, RE-FRAME was implemented via online resources, webinars, a backbone organization (SCOPE) coordinating the initiative, and a linking system supporting KT. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using surveys and stakeholder interviews, analyzed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. Existing communities described the consistency of Live 5-2-1-0 and extensive local partnerships/champions as catalysts for synergistic community-wide action; new communities felt that the simplicity of the message combined with the transfer of experiential learning would inform their own strategies and policies/programs to broadly disseminate Live 5-2-1-0. RE-FRAME effectively guided the refinement of the initiative and provided a framework upon which evaluation results described how to implement a community-based systems approach to childhood obesity prevention.",

The TODAY trial clearly demonstrated the challenges of treating this disease. Obesity is a key risk factor in the development of youth-onset T2D, and its prevention can mitigate the risk for developing T2D. However, childhood obesity prevention efforts to date have shown only modest effectiveness. Considering the larger, complex socioeconomic and cultural contexts that influence health behaviors among children and their families can enhance prevention efforts. Community-based participatory, multi-component, multi-setting childhood obesity prevention initiatives designed using the socio-ecological model and systems theory have been effective in sustainably decreasing childhood overweight and obesity. To advance our progress in treating and preventing T2D in youth, we must apply this new knowledge on community-wide childhood obesity prevention to enhance the impact of individual-level therapeutic strategies such as the TODAY intervention.",

An analysis of group interaction reveals several tensions in the process of knowledge integration, which can be grouped into three overarching dualities: 'simplicity versus complexity', 'constraining versus containing' and 'defining versus refining'. As group members take different positions with regard to these dualities, these represent sources of tension and potential 'stuckness' of the GMB. Hence the question arises how the group can manage duality in ways that take the GMB beyond its opposing forces. We suggest that knowledge integration processes may benefit from early recognition of the dualities at hand and strategies aimed at creating 'thirdness', including some suggestions on the concrete forms such 'thirdness' may take. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract="Water management in Uzbekistan (Central Asia) is facing tremendous challenges. They are rooted in past and present environmental degradation, the socio-economic transition after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the impacts of climate change. The Uzbek government has initiated reforms in the agricultural and water sectors to steer the socio-economic transition and address the threats of increasing water scarcity and decreasing agricultural productivity. However, despite the urgency of the problems and massive international assistance changes to the water management regime have only been minimal so far. In this paper we identify major structural barriers for adaptation of the water management regime through an analysis of two recent policy processes. Both processes address pressing water management issues such as `` coping with extreme events'' and `` providing water for ecosystems'' They were analyzed using the Management and Transition Framework as well as a group model building exercises with stakeholders on the national, regional and local levels. The analyses reveal a lack of vertical integration across administrative levels of the formal system and a still prevailing strong centralization of water management. Moreover the water management regime is strongly influenced by informal institutions that shape the outcomes of policy processes. The interactions guided by informal institutions provide an informal link between different administrative levels of the regime. However, those informal networks and the social capital embedded in them rather prevent needed changes. The resulting combination of top down institutional change initiated by socio-economic transition and bottom-up consolidation of the existing status quo via informal processes and networks prevents social learning. It also slows down an adaptation process that potentially could lead to a transition towards a more adaptive regime. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

note="Elsevier Ltd In many coastal regions, activities of multiple users present a growing strain on the ecological state of the area. The necessity of using integrative system approaches to understand and solve coastal problems has become obvious in the last decades. Integrated management strategies for social-ecological systems (SESs) call for the development of SES indicators that help (i) to identify and link the states and processes of social, economic and ecological subsystems and (ii) to balance different stakeholder objectives over the long-term within natural limits. Here we use a system dynamics modeling approach called group model building (GMB) as a diagnostic participative tool for understanding the determinants of characteristic SES issues in the Dutch Wadden Sea region and exploring salient SES indicators for management. We used GMB in two separate workshops for two distinct cases: sustainable mussel fisheries and tourism development. Follow-up online questionnaires elicited relevant variables for deriving SES indicators. In both modeling cases participants identified and connected the variables that expressed fundamental SES dynamics driving each issue. In the mussel fisheries model the central part of the structure was the interaction between the model variables 'extent of mussel habitat with high natural value', 'mussel cultivation efficiency', and 'market supply'. In the tourism model a key driving force for explaining tourist development was the reciprocal relation between the model variables 'natural value', 'experience value', and 'number of tourists'. Application of GMB revealed SES issue complexity and explicitly identified key linkages and potential SES indicators for policy and management in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. As a tool for stakeholder involvement in integrated coastal management the approach enables the joint building of system understanding and the exchange of individual perspectives. Participants agreed with the jointly created models and highly appreciated the way the structured approach facilitated communication and learning about complex and contested issues. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

note="Elsevier Ltd Specific methodologies that consider a more comprehensive/diverse set of parameters must be explored by the LCA community. This study utilises the Group Model-Building (GMB) method to identify, and Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) technique to make explicit, variables which are not typically considered in LCA studies, but may have significant influence upon environmental impacts through cause-effect links and feedback loops in product systems. A literature review on LCAs concerning household washing machines and conventional passenger cars product systems is performed to investigate what are the commonly used functional unit, life cycle stages and system boundaries. Two parallel GMB sessions were organised to elicit relevant variables and relations in the product systems and build in a first version of CLDs. Individual interviews with the participants were undertaken to refine and validate the system models. Final versions of the system models were built. GMB and CLD can serve as a basis for (i) delimitating appropriated system boundaries for LCA and (ii) identifying variables/areas to be included in sensitivity and scenario analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analysis examine the influence that those variables/areas have on the environmental impacts of the product and describe both different contexts and profiles of users. GMB and CLD have the potential to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative variables, for more robust understanding of the causes and mechanisms of environmental impacts and improving conclusions and recommendations in LCA. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

note="Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. Purpose: The resourcing of policing activity is characterised by a level of complexity, particularly where evaluating alternative policy options is concerned. In this paper, a case study using multimethodological modelling to compare alterative policy choice in a group context is outlined with respect to response-patrol officer (RPO) deployment within a UK police force. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The application of a three phase modelling process is illustrated where scenario planning is used to generate the scope of the system elements to be modelled. This is followed by causal mapping to identify the barriers to improving officer resourcing, and system dynamics modelling is used to simulate the impacts of a range of policy options within this policing function. A group model building approach was applied throughout the modelling phases with an expert group to negotiate a shared view of the structure and dynamics of the resourcing policy challenges. Findings: A fully validated system dynamics model emerged from the multi-phase modelling process which allowed a series of alternative future policy scenarios to be explored and evaluated. Useful policy insights were generated by the system dynamics simulation model which suggested more efficient rules for resource allocation in the police force's RPO function. Originality/value: The insights from this case study demonstrates that multi-phase modelling has potential application in policy exploration across a range of emergency service providers whose actions are governed by both variable demand and constrained supply of resource.

Stakeholders such as inhabitants, housing association managers, and police were directly involved in constructing a system dynamics model of their situation and defining actions to improve safety. Evaluation studies of group model-building typically assume that participants in modelling sessions share their insights, and in turn, the information exchanged changes their opinions. The modelling project addressed in this paper concerns a messy problem in a public multi-organizational setting, a situation characterized by ambiguity and conflict. We show that modelling in an ambiguous and conflicted situation helps participants to exchange information and change their opinions on the issue, even when not all conflicts are openly discussed.

In this paper we propose a general framework to study in vitro the impact of participatory modelling on natural resources management. We illustrate our framework by proposing an experimental setting that looks at participatory modelling in the context of water management. We realized a pilot experiment and show that this experimental setting can be used to test, in the laboratory, the hypothesis that participatory modelling of a common pool resource situation has an impact on the way the resource is managed and increases the cooperative behaviour of stakeholders. 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The contextual nature of the method and the flexibility required during the process mean that it is hard to build up evidence of what works and what does not. One major question is the extent to which the method can be compressed, for example, due to time or budget constraints. We present an experiment, carried out with a public organization, in which we tested two shortcuts. Firstly, we substituted the expert-driven preliminary model for a client-made model. Secondly, we allowed for a homogenous group because enlarging the group would be too time consuming. We defined several factors at the individual level and at the group level as dependent variables. We conclude that the shortcuts had a negative effect on most variables. We therefore recommend against these changes to the basic model. Copyright 2017 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

note="Elsevier Ltd Planning and decision-making vastly benefit from a holistic and systematic understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change and other non-climatic stressors on the health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems, and the efficacy of adaptation strategies and management interventions on mitigating these impacts and maintaining ecosystem condition and associated ecosystem service. This study reports on an approach to modelling coral reef stressors and possible adaptation interventions using the coral reef ecosystem of Port Resolution on Tanna Island, Vanuatu as the case study serving as a microcosm of endangered Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). A novel participatory modelling framework was developed and followed in a stepwise manner to integrate local and long-term climate change pressures by coupling structural analysis and the Bayesian Network (BN) techniques. The BN model was quantified through an advanced consolidated data-induced, evidence-based, and expert-driven approach that incorporated: (1) projections of future climate conditions and changing human activities; (2) the influences of multiple stressors including physical environmental and sociological factors; and (3) spatial variability in the key processes and variables. The first and second phases conceptualised the whole system by providing a graphical presentation of system variables within the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact (DPSI) framework using the structural analysis technique. In the third phase, the BN technique was used to integrate the outcomes of multidisciplinary assessments and analysis with experts opinion. The BN modelling phase was completed based on evidence extracted from literature which reported the results of regional and downscaled climate models, GIS-based analysis, parametrised data obtained from the region, and tacit knowledge elicited from experts. The validated model was employed to anticipate the future health and resilience condition of coral reefs under different sets of climatic trajectories and adaptive responses scenarios. The results predict the risks to the health and resilience of the Port Resolution coral reef system from the adverse impacts of climate change and harmful human activities and the possible success of adaptations strategies. A sobering conclusion was that despite the current satisfactory condition of coral reefs in the case study zone, their health and resilience would be severely threatened by 2070 in the absence of implementing adaptation strategies and associated sustainable management interventions. 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

note="Elsevier Ltd Recent estimates suggest that the construction sector accounts for approximately one quarter of global CO2 emissions. This paper assesses the potential for reducing the climate impact of road construction. The study is structured as a participatory integrated assessment with involvement from key stakeholders in the supply chain, supported by energy and material flow mapping, an extensive literature review and a scenario analysis. The results indicate that it is technically possible to halve road construction CO2 emissions with today's best available technologies and practices, to abate more than three quarters of the emissions by 2030 and achieve close to net zero emissions by 2045. Realising the current potential would rely on sufficient availability of sustainably produced second-generation biofuels, indicating a need to speed up the implementation of alternative abatement measures, including optimization of material use and mass handling requirements, increased recycling of steel, asphalt and aggregates and enhanced use of alternative binders in concrete. Policy measures and procurement strategies should be aligned to support these measures with a clear supply chain focus. For deep decarbonization several key opportunities and obstacles for realisation of breakthrough technologies for basic industry are highlighted including electrification and carbon capture for steel and cement, and hybridisation and electrification for heavy transport and construction equipment. There is a clear need to prepare for deeper abatement and associated transformative shifts already now and to carefully consider the pathway of getting there while avoiding pitfalls along the way, such as overreliance on biofuels or cost optimizations which cannot be scaled up to the levels required. 2019 The Authors",

note="Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a coherent theory and strategy for the achievement of quality outcomes that is meaningful and relevant to people at all levels of society. These should help the quality professional engage with people at all levels of society in the development of a culture that appreciates quality, systems and excellence. The research draws on the work of the community quality councils movement in the USA and sought to build on this experience in a village in northwest Ireland. Design/methodology/approach: Action research employing an ethnographic type approach to a four year immersion period in a small industrious community. Its inductive nature and naturalist mode of enquiry did not lend itself to either the generation or analysis of quantitative data. Nevertheless it yielded many rich complex pictures or patterns of qualitative information requiring long periods of reflection to decipher the sense and meaning in them. Findings: The findings can be encapsulated in one sentence ``To achieve quality outcomes we must practise excellence and maintain systems that are fit for purpose''. This requires a radical reworking of Demings system of profound knowledge (SoPK) to make it relevant to the human complex adaptive systems that permeate the twenty-first century. These operate as autonomous service providers in a rapidly changing environment. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this research have transferability to all sectors in society pursuing purposeful activity. It is relevant at individual, interest-group, industry, institution and community level. It should make the development of a ``quality culture'' more attainable at all levels. Practical implications: Provides quality professionals with new terminology and imagery to engage with, analyse and help autonomous human activity systems in the twenty-first century. It moves Demings SoPK to a new level more suited to human systems. Social implications: By explaining quality, excellence and systems in easily understood and accepted terms the Grange Excellence Model allows every individual, interest-group, industry and institution share the same language and images as they pursue quality outcomes. This unified approach could transform communities and society in general. Originality/value: The research generates a seismic shift in the appreciation of quality, excellence and systems making them relevant and meaningful to people at all levels of society. This provides quality professionals with a methodology, images and vocabulary that will facilitate productive engagement with purposeful systems at all levels of complexity. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

note="Canadian Science Publishing Increasing occurrences of natural disturbances, including windstorms and high snow cover, and supply chain risks lead to severe irregularities in wood harvest and transport. To overcome resulting supply difficulties, innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings. Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators, facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, workshops conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

Therefore, mental models constitute a valuable source of information, making it imperative to document them in detail, while preserving the integrity of stakeholders beliefs. We propose a methodology, the Rich Elicitation Approach (REA), which combines direct and indirect elicitation techniques to meet these goals. We describe the approach in the context of the effects of climate change on Baltic salmon. The REA produced holistic depictions of mental models, with more variables and causal relationships per diagram than direct elicitation alone, thus providing a solid knowledge base on which to begin PM studies. The REA was well received by stakeholders and fulfilled the substantive, normative, instrumental, and educational functions of PM. However, motivating stakeholders to confirm the accuracy of their models during the verification stage of the REA was challenging. 2019 The Authors",

note="Elsevier B.V. Participatory methods to support successful policy decisions regarding the complex and dynamic interactions of social, ecological, and physical processes involved in flooding must be simple, easy-to-use, and cost-efficient. Accordingly, a stepwise methodological framework based on causal loop diagrams (CLDs) was developed to address the challenge of context-sensitive initialization of key stakeholders in the collaborative flood risk management process. The methodology consists of five main stages: (i) problem definition, (ii) stakeholder analysis and identification of key groups, (iii) interviews with key stakeholders to construct individual CLDs, (iv) merging of individual CLDs to form a holistic qualitative model representing the entire system, and (v) implementation of an order-oriented reduction process to simplify the final merged CLD, thereby increasing understanding of the most important processes and feedbacks. The proposed approach for flood risk management was tested in a coastal area of southern Italy, a region historically affected by flood events. Given its simplicity, the proposed method was seen as a valuable tool to elicit and map mental models, especially when working with stakeholders who did not have prior modeling experience, i.e., farmers, agricultural companies, tourist complexes, and infrastructure authorities. Indeed, all stakeholders in the current study were able to understand the process and proposed different flood risk management policies, such as land-use changes, management of damage insurance payouts, floodplain activities, and improvement of public awareness. The proposed methodology overcame multiple barriers in initializing stakeholder engagement, including the technical focus of most flood management agencies, the additional cost and time requirements for stakeholder involvement, as well as institutional structures that impede collaborative management. Moreover, the results point to socio-economic aspects of flood risk management that have not been considered in previous modeling studies. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

note="Elsevier Ltd This paper develops a qualitative causal model of a water, energy, and food (WEF) security nexus system to be used in analysing the interlinkages among those and other sectors that influence and are influenced by each other in a local context. Local stakeholder engagement through a group model building (GMB) approach was applied in Karawang Regency, Indonesia, to develop the model with the goals of improving problem understanding, raising consensus among participants, and building acceptance and commitment regarding the subsequent development of a quantitative nexus model. After recognizing the issues regarding water, energy and food sectors in the study area and eliciting opinions about nexus interactions, the next stage was to build a conceptual framework to describe the nexus system and to develop an integrated causal loop diagram (CLD) that describes critical system (inter-)linkages. The developed Karawang WEF security (K-WEFS) model is composed of six sub-models with water, energy and food sectors as endogenous factors. In addition, population, economic and ecosystem services were considered as exogenous drivers of the system. It is expected that all the major internal and external factors and drivers are covered, including possible feedback mechanisms, and key variables will be analysed further in the system. The future achievement of WEF security targets can be based on robust evaluation and planning processes underpinned by thorough understanding of whole system dynamics and the impacts of changes in the linked sectors, even in a qualitative way. In this way, a first step towards breaking silo thinking in regional planning may be attained. 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

note="Elsevier Inc. This study argues that the mainstream approaches to system dynamics (SD) modeling processes lack effective impact-based performance management tools and, paradoxically, build upon a nonsystemic view of some social dynamics that are key to sustainability transformations. A causal loop diagram of the mainstream approaches to participatory SD modeling is developed to discuss the fragilities of the learning and decision-making systems that result from such approaches. The analysis suggests that when common resources are at stake, ad hoc organizational solutions are needed at the field level, in addition to the traditional facilitating action at the project/group level, for SD modeling to succeed. Then, to address the fragilities of the existing approaches to participatory SD modeling, this study integrates concepts and solutions from institutional theories, adaptive co-management, and the body of knowledge on the (new) commons. A second causal loop diagram is provided to show how this new proposed approach could restructure the processes that link SD modeling inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts due to a higher-level permanent organizational unit with specific roles and data management capabilities labeled ``smart commons organization''. This study suggests that the proposed smart commons approach could enhance the contribution of SD modeling to sustainability transformations. 2019 The Authors",

note="Elsevier Inc. Effectively evaluating public policy based on diverse public interests and requirements under the incremental social change in a developing city is a critical challenge. Fairness and an objective policy evaluation process need to be considered to deliver the expected policy value with large-scale population concerns. This study attempts to propose a novel stakeholder-based policy evaluation model to drive the enhancement of policy evaluation through three phases, that is, (1) policy document analysis, (2) evaluators identification, and (3) participatory policy evaluation. In Phase 1, a selection of policy measures and policy stakeholders identification are analysed using a document analysis approach. In Phase 2, evaluators identification procedures are adopted to identify key participants through social network analysis (SNA). Finally, AHP-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is used in the third phase to better evaluate the policy. Then, a comprehensive case study of the urban traffic restriction policy of Xi'an City is demonstrated to verify this approach. Public participation and the indirect effect are revealed as vital factors that impact the effectiveness and vitality of public policy development. The implications are discussed to obtain valuable insights for suggestions on future policies. 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

note="Tempus Publications Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA) developed the Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (PMEL) framework to confront the complex challenges inherent in international community development projects. The first critical step of the PMEL framework requires thoughtful exploration of ``pathways'' to community change: a series of proposed actions that lead to a set of positive outcomes within the community. In this study, we investigate the benefit of using Group Model Building (GMB) as a way to improve the outcome of brainstorming sessions, a key aspect of team decision making within this first step of the PMEL framework. Here we posit an important mechanism for an improved outcome in brainstorming sessions would be a shift in student mental models towards system thinking. In order to assess the value proposition of GMB in project decision making, a two-session GMB workshop was held with a EWB-USA student team working on a rural water project in Peru. A mixed-methods approach was used to extract and analyze participant mental models before and after the workshop to measure growth in systems thinking. The results of the study indicate compelling shifts in participants' mental models towards those of systems thinkers, including an understanding of important factors and how they influence as a system to impact project sustainability. Marked changes in project planning action items were also observed along with an alignment of their proposed change pathways. Overall, the project team gained a more complete understanding and appreciation of project complexity and of the factors that contribute to project success. Thus, GMB provides a useful technique to teach engineering students systems thinking, while possibly improving the quality, and thus sustainability, of EWB community development projects. 2017 Tempus Publications.",

note="Elsevier B.V. Urban ecosystem services (UES) are the benefits supplied by nature to people in urban systems. The supply of UES is threatened because of widespread increasing urbanisation. Modelling scenarios that optimise UES supplies can support sustainable urban planning processes. UES are linked to land use/land cover (LULC) types, which enables the optimisation of UES supply to be based on LULC configurations. However, current modelling approaches are not suitably adapted to the link between UES optimisation and LULC configurations. One possibility to target UES optimal supply is to use mathematical optimisation methods. The objective of this study is to test the combined use of participatory modelling and optimisation models to deliver spatial solutions that maximise UES by optimal urban LULC configurations. An integrated model is built using a multi-objective integer linear programming (MOILP) model along with LULC performance scores to maximise a set of locally supplied UES. This is illustrated with a case study of Lisbon (Portugal) involving the participation of key stakeholders to validate and benchmark the selection of optimisation constraints. Results show land optimally allocated to land cover types with high UES functions combined with a reshuffling and densification of residential land. Thus, the new LULC configuration increased multiple UES supplies while maintaining a level of housing capacity. The model shows clear implications of increasing land cover types whose UES functions are high compared to most other LULC classes. Moreover, incorporating stakeholder participatory modelling offers a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary scientific contribution intersecting mathematical optimisation, UES, and urban planning. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

note="Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. Purpose: Present-day engineering education is in dire need to expose would-be engineers to a systemic view of the world. Societys problems are getting increasingly complex ``wicked'' problems, and they require inter and transdisciplinary approaches to understand and ``dissolve'' them (that is to solve them systemically). In this context, the purpose of this paper is to invite engineering educators to reflect on the need to teach systems thinking and spark their interest on finding appropriate methods to do so. This paper aims to describe an actual intervention at Universidad de Ibague (UNIBAGUE), Colombia, where the methodology of teaching systems thinking as a foreign language has been on trial for one year. Design/methodology/approach: Starting with a simple model of teaching systems thinking, and using an action-research methodology, the teaching model is gradually evolved to a model for teaching systems thinking as a foreign language. Findings: The authors only have preliminary qualitative results with this systems-thinking teaching model. Although these results are encouraging (the authors think basic systems concepts are better apprehended by the students), further research is needed. One objective of the present paper is precisely to invite engineering educators to experiment with this teaching model. Research limitations/implications: The authors think it is necessary to exploit further the teaching-a-foreign-language analogy. There is a vast experience on methods for teaching second and foreign languages. They could enrich the method and hint at possible directions for further research. Practical implications: Teaching systems thinking is a field still open for wide research. The pedagogical model developed in this research to teach systems thinking could benefit other teachers of systems thinking to build upon. Social implications: As one of the referees pointed out: ``The implications of the insides obtained in this research are very significant to society. The problem observed in the systems thinking researchers and practitioner's community about how to disseminate systems thinking knowledge and how to embed this way of thinking into the minds of young people (K-12, university, etc.) is addressed in this research. In it is shown an experience that provides very valuable insides about how this can be done. Originality/value: The idea of teaching systems thinking as a foreign language has not been widely explored. Furthermore, we feel that inasmuch as systems thinking is more of a skill or competency, than a technique or theory, then the model of teaching which emerges from this case study might be more appropriate than models of teaching based in the old educational paradigm. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

note="ICE Publishing Participatory modelling in water resource management-involving diverse actors in what is traditionally a purely analytical process-is thought to broaden stakeholder engagement and improve outcomes. Further research and case studies are required to explore the practicalities of integrating meaningful participation within modelling processes in the water sector. Participatory modelling may be of particular interest within the context of urban informal areas, where the confluence of climate change, urbanisation and contested land requires new methods for engagement and planning. This paper develops new case-based knowledge to inform the application of participatory modelling and planning for informal urban areas. A flood-modelling project in the large informal neighbourhood of Kibera in central Nairobi, Kenya, is analysed using a newly established framework for the classification of participatory modelling approaches developed by Basco-Carrera et al. in 2017. Conclusions suggest that the further upstream more diverse stakeholders can be involved, the better the chance of co-producing new knowledge and of creating implementable plans and policies. At the same time, delivering 'co-design' of modelling processes in areas of limited co-operation requires a strong vision for participation, a tolerance for contention, a willingness to learn between actors and a budget to support additional time inputs. 2019 Published with permission by the ICE under the CC-BY 4.0 license.",

note="Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. Purpose: Previous research studies have testified that safety culture positively affects safety performance. However, the progression by which safety culture affects safety performance has not yet been examined. Also, how safety culture affects the overall safety performance at different levels of the organization is yet to be explored. In order to address this issue, the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of multilevel safety culture upon safety performance over time. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual causal-loop diagram is constructed using the group model building approach to establish the relationship between safety culture components (e.g. psychological, behavioral and situational) and the factors associated with safety performance (e.g. risk level, safety behavior, unsafe conditions, unsafe acts and incident rate). Considering the dynamic nature and intricacy of the safety management system, the system dynamics approach has been employed to develop the model. Findings: The results indicate that the safety culture at the tactical level (middle management) and operational level is much more effective than strategic level (top management) in ameliorating the safety performance of the organization. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this study is limited to the effect of multilevel safety culture on safety performance. The focus is on the dynamics of personal, behavioral and situational factors of top management, middle management and workers to reinforce the safety performance of the organization. Future research can be protracted to build other models of safety. Practical implications: First and foremost, the findings summarized in this paper can be implemented by organizations to achieve the total safety culture to upgrade safety performance. Originality/value: This paper presents the holistic view of multilevel safety culture in an organizations hierarchy. It shows how multilevel level safety culture in an organization interacts with the safety management system to enhance the safety performance of the organization. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

note="John Wiley and Sons Ltd Sugar-sweetened beverage tax (SSB tax) has been proposed in Thailand in an attempt to reduce sugar content in beverages and sugar consumption among the Thai population. However, it is uncertain if the SSB tax will translate into lower sugar consumption and consequently improve dental caries. This paper aims to elicit and represent the complex dynamic relationships between SSB tax, sugar consumption, and dental caries in Thailand. A group model building approach, based on the systems modelling methodology of system thinking, was used to engage stakeholders to develop a causal loop diagram (causal map) to elucidate the dynamic interrelationships of SSB tax on sugar consumption and dental caries. The causal loop diagram identified seven balancing feedback loops and one reinforcing feedback loop. The balancing loops operate to reduce the prevalence of dental caries and the impact of SSB tax on SSB consumption, while the reinforcing loop operates to maintain the share of SSB consumption among the Thai population. The main insight from this study suggests that implementing SSB tax alone will not achieve the desired oral health outcomes, without combining it with other non-tariff interventionssuch as oral health education and improved access to oral health services. 2018 John Wiley Sons, Ltd. 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

note="John Wiley and Sons Ltd In the context of facilitated, technology-supported efforts to resolve complex problems, we recognize the critical role that visual representations can play in both the content and process of collaboration. How these representations are wielded by facilitators and interpreted by participants determines whether they help resolve conflicts or close down conversations. We identify three key attributes of scripted problem-solving facilitation, as well as three key attributes of visual representations that function as boundary objects, to gain insights into pivotal experiences when group problem-solving efforts turned from collaboration to conflict and vice versa. We draw on three vignettes from facilitated group problem solving to illustrate how these attributes can be deployed to move conflict-mired conversations into collaborative discussions. This paper contributes to collaborative problem solving by using the formal sociological theory of boundary objects to offer a deeper, richer understanding of successes and shortcomings of visual representations as drivers of conflict resolution in model-building approaches. 2012 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",

note="Elsevier Ltd Whilst the concept of a learning curve is well established, within organisational settings the coordinates of points on the curve often remain unmeasured. Devon and Cornwall Police are a UK police force that is seeking to better allocate officer resource to high volumes of crime demand through understanding the relationship between levels of officer learning and development and the time required to resolve crimes. Devon and Cornwall Police subscribed to building a system dynamics simulation model of officer resourcing, within which an aggregate learning curve would convert levels of available officer experience into time required to resolve volume crime. Fragmented learning curve data meant that judgmental data needed to be elicited from expert practitioners in order to establish a consensus based measure of bivariate relationships. VISCONS is a judgmental method that was developed to help Devon and Cornwall Police quantify these relationships in a group setting. Three components are synergised into the VISCONS approach, namely: visual or graphical elicitation, parameterisation and consensus through group model building. The method brings together expert practitioners to arrive at a single shared view of the quantified bivariate relationship from a set of individual perspectives. Experts are involved in sketching their views onto acetates before overlaying them into a set of agreed parameter values. Experts do not require any knowledge of system dynamics simulation techniques, as they are facilitated in a single workshop to represent and amalgamate different views and perspectives on the parameterisation problem under consideration. The group is able to validate resulting bivariate parameter values using an efficient graphical method of data capture. VISCONS can be used for parameter capture beyond the scope of learning curves or system dynamics. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

note="Elsevier The protection of critical infrastructure requires an understanding of the effects of change on current and future safety and operations. Vulnerabilities may emerge during the rollout of updated techniques and integration of new technology with existing work practices. Managers need to understand how their decisions, often focused on economic priorities, affect the dynamics of vulnerability over time. Such understanding is difficult to obtain, as the historical data typically used for decision support, prediction and forecasting may not be available. We report on the use of group model building and simulation to consider proactively the effects of a 10-year, multi-billion dollar modernization of offshore oil operations. A system dynamics model defines the problem in terms of the structure of work process and knowledge transitions. The model is parameterized with data from workshops conducted with groups of experts in oil production. The simulation suggests that vulnerability increases from the alterations to work process and knowledge associated with change, and only resolves as these alterations are absorbed into normal activities and experience. The forces that generate vulnerability compound in unanticipated ways, leading to possible exponential growth in the cost of incidents. The numerical results, while based on theory and assumptions made in the absence of historical data, indicate that accelerating the IO transition may increase incident costs sufficiently to put the program at risk. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: We describe how group model building and simulation techniques establish a problem domain and focus in the critical infrastructure arena where traditional data-driven methods are not available. The model quantifies the effects of operational and behavioral variables surrounding the effects of technology change, including areas that are difficult to measure directly, such as knowledge and vulnerability. Finally, the ability to consider a wide range of effects and outcomes in the absence of historical data provides a starting point for managerial ideation about the need for vulnerability mitigation. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

note="John Wiley and Sons Ltd The question of how to organize collaborative problem solving efforts when collective action is necessary has received considerable attention in the scientific literature. However, many such contributions neglect the role of the governance system in which processes evolve. These systems are complex, and the actors involved have a high degree of selforganizing capacity at their disposal. Actors create and recreate the rules of the game, draw and redraw boundaries, and develop and redevelop patterns of interaction. The governance of the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol demonstrates the complexity of a compounded governance system and the influence this has on collaborative problem solving. In this paper, we analyse two attempts to organize collaborative problem-solving efforts. Although the government assumed itself to be in charge, we demonstrate that the collaborative problem-solving efforts are seriously hampered by the self-organizing capacity of actors in neighbouring subsystems. 2012 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",

abstract="Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a simulation-based approach to examine the efficacy of management options in achieving fishery-, ecosystem-, and socioeconomic-related objectives while integrating over system uncertainties. As a form of structured decision analysis, MSE is amenable to stakeholder involvement, which can reduce implementation barriers associated with nontransparent decision-making procedures. Based on analysis of three MSE processes (Atlantic tunas (Thunnus spp.), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica)), we provide suggestions for improving stakeholder engagement in MSE. By assembling a workgroup and modeling team with diverse backgrounds, including professional facilitators, communication liaisons, and social scientists, dialogue can be improved and an atmosphere of mutual learning fostered. Communication further benefits from clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and terms of engagement for all involved; explicitly and transparently identifying goals and objectives of the MSE before modeling has begun; and, when appropriate, revisiting goals and objectives throughout the MSE process. Although MSEs are not without limitations, the participatory modeling framework, wherein stakeholders are actively engaged at each stage of MSE development, provides a useful mechanism to support fisheries management.",

abstract="The sustainable governance and management of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is challenging, largely due to their dynamic and complex nature. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling approach that can account for the dynamism and complexity in SSF by modeling entities as individual agents with different characteristics and behavior, and simulate how their interactions can give rise to emergent phenomena, such as over-fishing and social inequalities. The structurally realistic design of agent-based models allow stakeholder, experts and scientists across disciplines and sectors to reconcile different knowledge bases, assumptions, and goals. ABMs can also be designed using any combination of theory, quantitative data, or qualitative data. In this publication we elaborate on the untapped potential of ABM to tackle governance and management challenges in SSF, discuss the limitations of ABM, and review its application in published SSF models. Our review shows that, although few models exist to date, ABM has been used for diverse purposes, including as a research tool for understanding cooperation and over-harvesting, and as a decision-support tool, or participatory tool, in case-specific fisheries. Even though the development of ABMs is often time- and resource intensive, it is the only dynamic modeling approach that can represent entities of different types, their heterogeneity, actions and interactions, thus doing justice to the complex and dynamic nature of SSF which, if ignored can lead to unintended policy outcomes and less sustainable SSF.",

abstract="The aquaculture industry in Norway currently represents 60{\%} (US{\$} 5.4 billion) of Norwegian seafood exports. Of these, farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) represents over 80{\%} (850,000 tonnes). These production levels are driven by a strong and growing demand for farmed fish, and has a stated political goal of increased growth by a factor of 5 by 2050 in Norway alone. However, growth is potentially more challenging without the public support and trust in the governance regime that regulates the industry. The theoretical framework of this paper rests on accountability theory, whereby the research team highlighted and tested the paradox between the ideal and the actual practices on a group of stakeholders representing the aquaculture industry and municipal, regional and sector management in northern Norway relative to their interactions and need thereof -- versus the expectations of the public. The findings of a workshop were used to develop a conceptual model and test our theory on stakeholder driven future scenarios using a combination of systems thinking and fuzzy cognitive mapping. We found that stakeholders and management alike in a workshop setting valued flexibility of legislation and expert opinions highly, whereby regulatory standardization is not prioritized -- in line with soft accountability. The industry acknowledged, though, that the public perception and negative media attention of the industry, in turn depended on hard accountability.",

abstract="Rice is the third grown crop worldwide and responsible of significant environmental impacts. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the organic rice- performance and management, probably due to the limits encountered by the reductionist approach in studying complex systems such as an organic paddy. The study proposes a knowledge-intensive and qualitative research methodology based on researcher-farmer participatory approach, with the aim to improve the state of knowledge on organic rice, explore the yield potential and variability, and identify the successful agronomic practices. A wide range of cropping systems placed in North Italy were monitored and analysed during three years by a multi-actor network. Knowledge was generated from collected data and information, integrating the scientific and empirical knowledge on the basis of the DIKW hierarchy and through mutual learning and knowledge sharing tools. The organic rice field proved to be a complex and difficult to predict system, which evolves over the time, under the on-going pressure of the bottom-up innovations, and whose performance depends on many interacting elements. The results highlighted three main knowledge-intensive management strategies, not involving universal recipes but a range of agroecological principles and flexible solutions that the farmers adapt to the time- and space- variability through an active adaptive management. Yield showed a wide variability (0-7 t/ha) and normal distribution (median 4 t/ha). The lower, middle and upper quartiles of yield showed a mean of about 2, 4 and 6 t/ha, respectively, with high variance associated with upper and lower quartiles. The variability sources related to the management and effectiveness in weed control have mainly determined the productivity gap, -Know-how- (suitability of the chosen management plan), -optimization- (timely and accuracy of interventions) and -seed bank- (previous operations and land uses affecting the weeds dynamics) were responsible of the low yield in 77{\%}, 54{\%} and 31{\%} of the cases, respectively, drowning out the impact of climate, soil and variety.Results are useful to drive further scientific inquiries and evaluations consistently with the faced reality by the farmers, and suggest that improvements in the farmer- know-how and skills can lead to further yield increase and variability reduction. The participatory research, adopted to explore complex systems, has worked in this direction, fostering the co-creation of knowledge and innovation and the social cohesion. However, the methodology showed constraints mainly related to the time-consuming surveys and its nature affected by human component.",

abstract="Upcycling is a process in which used or waste products and materials are repaired, reused, repurposed, refurbished, upgraded and remanufactured in a creative way to add value to the compositional elements. It has been part of human life throughout history, and the past few years have seen its revival, driven by multiple factors including growing concern for the environment and resource scarcity. Upcycling increases quality and lifetimes of materials and products, reduces wastes, creates employment opportunities, and encourages sustainable consumer behaviour. Despite such benefits and increasing interest, upcycling is largely considered as a niche practice. One of the important gaps in the current state of knowledge on upcycling is a lack of systemic understanding about challenges and success factors relating to scaling up upcycling businesses. This paper aims to address this gap by employing a broad range of methods for reaching its goal, including literature review, stakeholder analysis, semi-structured interviews, group model building, development of causal loop diagrams, and a workshop with stakeholders and experts to validate causal loop diagrams and discuss promising interventions and how to proceed. The results identified potential actors for the success of upcycling businesses, key challenges and success factors, causal linkages among the challenges and success factors, key system mechanisms, and interventions for scaling up upcycling businesses. Collaboration across the upcycling value chain involving a wide range of actors is also discussed.",

abstract="The management of social-ecological systems often presents a complex and wicked problem due to interactions between natural processes and varied, sometimes opposing, stakeholder goals. The adaptive management and participatory modelling processes are often used either to manage or in support of the management of social-ecological systems but are not always used in concert. We suggest that these processes are naturally complementary with overlapping components and between-process feedback. As such, we advocate that adaptive management should make use of participatory modelling for the management of social-ecological systems to increase stakeholder communication, confidence, and participation, streamline management strategy development, and improve management strategy application and durability. We present a translation of the typical adaptive management cycle concept to a spiral format, as well as a representation of adaptive management and participatory modelling proceeding together as interconnected spirals.",

abstract="Food systems will need to undergo considerable transformation. To be better prepared for and resilient to uncertainty and disturbances in the future, resource users and managers need to further develop knowledge about the food and farming system, with its dominating feedback structures and complexities, and to test robust and integrated system-based solutions. This paper investigates how participatory system dynamics modeling can be adapted to groups at the community level with low or no formal educational background. The paper also analyses the refinement of workshop participants- mental models as a consequence of a participatory system dynamics intervention. For this purpose, we ran two workshops with small-scale farmers in Zambia. Analysis of workshop data and post-workshop interviews shows that participatory system dynamics is well adaptable to support an audience-specific learning-by-doing approach. The use of pictures, objects and water glasses in combination with the basic aspects of causal loop diagramming makes for a well-balanced toolbox. Participants acquire understanding that is also relevant beyond systems thinking in that it offers a range of practical insights such as a critical evaluation of common food security strategies.",

abstract="842 million people worldwide are undernourished, while simultaneously the number of overweight and obese individuals increased to 2.1 billion in 2013. There is growing opinion that addressing the global burden of diet-related disease requires a much more comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach than stand-alone public health nutrition interventions such as nutrition education or food labelling. Instead, we need to develop whole of systems interventions to address the core problem and consider the way we grow, process, distribute and commercialize our food. However, there is little evidence or guidance on how to best achieve this goal. This research aims to develop a whole of food systems approach for public health nutrition research by building on systems methods from other fields of science. Specific objectives are to: 1) identify systems methods that are applicable to public health nutrition research; 2) identify how these systems methods and public health research can best be integrated.We explored a range of systems methods which could potentially be applied to public health nutrition research. Based on these, we developed a framework for using and combining different systems methods in public health nutrition research. The framework consists of three main phases: A) availability and affordability of (un)healthy food; B) determinants of (un)healthy food availability and affordability; and C) food system intervention development. Phase A forms the platform of this research combining a series of smaller projects examining food availability, affordability and healthiness. Phase B uses global value chain analysis (GVCA) to identify different attributes of value, including both health and monetary values. Phase C aims to identify sustainable food system public health interventions using Group Model Building (GMB) and logistic modelling approaches.This paper presents why and how systems methods can be used in public health nutrition research. The food system is highly complex and this complexity needs to be acknowledged to find solutions for the current nutrition challenges (obesity, under nutrition), which cannot be solved in isolation. We envision that the methods presented in this paper can form the basis for future research in this area where it can be applied to other public health nutrition research (for example other food products, in relation to specific diseases, different countries) as well as other domains of a sustainable food system not specifically focused on here e.g. economic, social and specific environmental outcomes.",

abstract="Rangeland-based livestock systems have to deal with the significant instability and uncertainty of the agricultural context (policy changes, volatility of input prices, etc.), and especially of the climatic context. Thus, they are particularly concerned by adaptive management strategies. To support the development of such strategies, we developed a board game including a computer model called cOppRangeland RummycOpp. It is to be used by groups of farmers and agricultural consultants in the context of short workshops (about 3cph). Rangeland Rummy builds upon five types of material object: (i) a game board; (ii) a calendar stick indicating the starting date of the game board; (iii) sticks marked with the feed resources available for combinations of vegetation types and their management practices; (iv) cards to define animal groups and their feeding requirements throughout the year; (v) cards related to types of feed that can be attributed to animal groups throughout the year. Using these material objects, farmers collectively design a rangeland-based livestock system. This system is immediately evaluated using a computer model, i.e. a spreadsheet providing graphs and indicators providing information on, among other things, the extent to which quantitative and qualitative animal feeding requirements are covered across the year. Playing the game thus consists in collectively and iteratively designing and evaluating rangeland-based livestock systems, while confronting the players with new contextual challenges (e.g. interannual variability of weather, volatility of input prices) or new farmers' objectives (e.g. being self-sufficient for animal feeding). An example of application of Rangeland Rummy with 3 farmers in southern France is reported. Applications show that it tends to develop farmers' adaptive capacity by stimulating their discussions and the exchange of locally-relevant knowledge on management strategies and practices in rangeland-based livestock systems.",

abstract="<bold>Background: </bold>In coproduction research, traditional 'end-users' are involved in the entire research process. The aim is to facilitate research translation by improving the timeliness and relevance of research. Because end-users often come from multiple sectors and hold diverse perspectives and priorities, involving them in coproduction can be challenging. Tools and approaches are needed to support coproduction teams to successfully navigate divergent viewpoints while producing rigorous but meaningful research outcomes. Rich pictures are a systems thinking tool to help make sense of complexity. In this paper, we describe how we developed and applied a 'rich picture' in a coproduction project with policy-level partners.<bold>Methods: </bold>Guided by systems thinking principles, we conducted a systemic analysis of ethnographic fieldnotes collected as part of a broader study that examined the dynamics between an IT system and the implementation of the state-wide childhood obesity prevention programmes it was designed to monitor. Translating qualitative themes into metaphor and imagery, we created a visual depiction of the system to reflect the experience of the system's users (health promotion practitioners) and facilitated a workshop with policy-level programme administrators (i.e. participants, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7). Our aim was to increase the transparency of the system for our research partners and to spark new insights to improve the quality of programme implementation.<bold>Results: </bold>Guided by provocative questions, participants discussed and challenged each other's thinking on the current functioning of the system. They identified future lines of inquiry to explore for quality improvement. Participants strongly agreed that the picture was a constructive way to engage with the ethnographic data but were challenged by the information and its implications. The opportunity for participants to co-learn from each other as well as from the picture was an added value.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In the context of the facilitated workshop, the rich picture enabled research partners to engage with complex research findings and gain new insights. Its value was harnessed via the guided participatory process. This demonstrates the importance that, in the future, such tools should be accompanied by practices that enable participants to think with and apply systems thinking concepts and principles.

abstract="The consumer's central role within biodiversity conservation networks may be connected to the process of reconnecting models of production and proven local consumption within ``alternative food networks'' that have the ability to conserve biodiversity and create sustainable production. This research focuses of the indirect relationships between consumers of biodiversity-friendly vegetable crops surveyed at the main farmers' markets in Sicily, revealing details of purchasing behaviour and the factors related to product choice using social network analysis (SNA) to analyse the social relationships. The research highlights the consumer preferences for local produce or areas with an identity connection or an ethical-social affinity, as shown by the convergence of themes such as ``territorial promotion'' and ``Sicilian quality''. This result confirms the role of low-volume producers and local communities in protecting biodiversity-friendly farming and renewing their importance in policy-making. Different consumers highlighted how important it is to design more effective measures to maintain and increase ecosystem resilience. Future development in this area will need to include empirical research on defining the motivations that induce consumers to collaborate with producers in the co-creation of values and anticipating the willingness of consumers to be more pro-active and participatory with biodiversity-friendly farmers in managing their relationships.

abstract="The First Nation communities in northern Ontario have unique energy-related challenges within an interdisciplinary context, including historical, geographic, cultural, technological, and regulatory. Presently, undergoing an energy systems transition from off-grid to grid-connection and scoping renewable energy options, these remote communities are exhibiting characteristics of complex adaptive system principles. This is exhibited through non-linear interactions and connectedness among agents and components in the emerging energy system. This paper explores these interfaces through a case study of Poplar Hill First Nation, an Independent Power Authority community. The potentials of the complexity science through a community engagement process is used to encode and enhance understanding of the ``contextual'' complexities in the development of local economies, adapting to technology advancement, and social changes. The findings will help better appreciate the efforts made by Poplar Hill in their transition to self-sufficient systems with deliberations that may provide practical outcomes. This paper reflects on the deeper trajectories of the human elements embedded within the energy transition process. In conclusion, the paper adds to the academic dialogue on energy system transition adaptations in marginalised Indigenous communities in rural and remote locations.

abstract="Critically reflecting on researcher--community partnerships is a key component in implementing chronic condition interventions in Indigenous communities. This paper draws on the results and learnings from a process evaluation that measures how well two research--community partnerships have followed the He Pikinga Waiora (HPW) Implementation Framework while co-designing chronic condition interventions in primary care. The HPW framework is centred on Indigenous self-determination and knowledge surrounded by community engagement, cultural centredness, systems thinking and integrated knowledge translation. The evaluation included in-depth interviews and online surveys with 10 team members. The findings demonstrate that the HPW framework was followed well, with strengths particularly in community engagement and relationship building. Areas for improvement included systems thinking and integrated knowledge translation to support sustainability of the interventions. The need for partnerships to use process evaluation results to support critical reflection is asserted, which helps build strong trust and synergy, power sharing and effective and sustainable implementation practices. It is concluded that the HPW framework is well suited to evaluating implementation of health interventions in primary care as it assists in the facilitation of better collaboration between researchers and Indigenous communities, and encourages the implementation team to reflect on power and privilege.

abstract="The aim of this research was to expand the current understanding of social aspects related to the successful adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to support mechanical--electrical--plumbing (MEP) coordination and identify contributions of the Last Planner System (LPS) to tackle these aspects. The paper presents an action-research project carried out by a mechanical contractor. This study revealed that successful BIM-enabled MEP coordination depends not only on efforts to coordinate the model itself, but also on how effectively it is used during the installation phase. Social elements that influenced the effectiveness of BIM-enabled MEP coordination were classified in three categories: clarity of roles and responsibilities, individual vs. collective project leadership, and the existence of agreed-upon processes to follow. In such context, the LPS contributed to strengthening teamwork, providing a structure for increased communication and accountability, and helping the project team to focus on problem-solving. Consequently, the model was used more effectively, reducing rework and improving field productivity.

abstract="This paper explores the usefulness of rich pictures as a method in Systemic Lean Intervention (SLI) process. It combines Lean and Systems Thinking analytical tools. Lean emerged with the main objectives of waste identification and removal in an operational system - which is synonymous to cost reduction, and value maximization. The research focuses on the use of rich pictures alongside lean tools such as workshop and interviews in a participatory research process, involving the identified stakeholders who are affected by the operational process. The research applies these tools with the intent to recognise the impacts of the various parts that function together in the operational process. A single case study organisation of a commercial Livestock farm in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria was used. The research found out that the application of rich pictures could be influenced by certain factors like the participants' interest, power and authority possession of some participants, familiarity with the issues considered, and the participants' level of background knowledge on the usage of rich pictures. Rich pictures were also found to be time-consuming in its interpretation and application to addressing identified issues.

abstract="This paper describes an action research study where the researcher developed and tested an alternative business requirements elicitation approach that enables reflection on business intelligence business requirements from a social/organisational perspective and, accordingly, surfaces user-centric requirements that support development of systems that are technically good and effectuate organisational improvement. It is based on critical systems heuristics, a framework that facilitates participative discourse to surface contributing and consequential factors of a planned social system, i.e. relevant sources of motivation; expertise; inflicting and controlling boundaries; and sources of moral and political justification acting as guardians for all that will be impacted upon by the adjusted social reality caused by the new system. Such an approach is valuable to developers of business intelligence systems; it complements traditional requirements gathering approaches. Present-day organisations require efficacious decision-making capabilities to succeed---business intelligence systems enable efficacious decisions. However, business intelligence systems often fail, at great expenses to organisations. They fail due to social/organisational infeasibility, rather than technical insufficiency; they fail when developers lack adequate understanding of users' business requirements. Appropriate business requirement specifications entail more than definitions of functional, non-functional and technical attributes of new systems. Business requirements must also capture the social/organisational context of a system, i.e. the impact that it will inevitably have on users and the organisational environment, so as to ensure that it ultimately bring about improvement. The approach developed in this study enables elicitation of user-centric business requirements.

abstract="Achieving equitable and sustainable development that supports climate change mitigation targets and avoids biodiversity loss remains a leading, and intractable challenge in many tropical countries. Sectorial thinking -- focusing on just one aspect of the problem or system -- is increasingly understood to be inadequate to address linked social-ecological challenges. Holistic approaches that incorporate diverse stakeholders across scales, sectors, and knowledge systems are gaining prominence for addressing complex problems. Such 'integrated landscape approaches' have received renewed momentum and interest from the research, donor and practitioner communities, and have been subsumed in international conventions related to climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development. However, implementation efforts and tangible evaluation of progress continues to lag behind conceptual development. Failure of landscape approaches to adequately engage diverse stakeholders---in design, implementation and evaluation---is a contributing factor to their poor performance. Here we draw on consultation workshops, advances in the literature, and our collective experience to identify key constraints and opportunities to better engage stakeholders in tropical landscape decision-making processes. Specifically, we ask: (1) what are the key challenges related to effectively engaging multiple stakeholders in integrated landscape approaches and (2) what lessons can be learned from practitioners, and how can these lessons serve as opportunities to avoid duplicating future research efforts or repeating past perceptions of underperformance. We present our findings within three broad categories: (i) navigating complexity, (ii) overcoming siloed thinking, and (iii) incentivizing behavioral change; thus providing a useful starting point for overcoming inherent challenges associated with engaging stakeholders in landscape approaches. {\textbullet} Engagement benefits from boundary support and independent facilitation to integrate expert and community experiences. {\textbullet} Co-produced theories of change enhance shared understanding of desired outcomes and measurable process indicators. {\textbullet} Incentive structures generate variable responses and therefore must be carefully contextualized. {\textbullet} Participatory modeling makes assumptions explicit, enabling transparent decision-making. {\textbullet} Forecasting exercises enhance knowledge, capacity and empathy by exposing actors to diverse perspectives. {\textbullet} Locally relevant people-based strategies are crucial to secure meaningful and long-term engagement.

abstract="Human activities such as modification of waterways, deforestation of catchments, and development on floodplains interact with the natural environment and may cause adverse environmental effects. Therefore, the multiple causes and consequences of flooding resulting from human environment interactions, require a holistic understanding of complex social-economical-environmental systems. Moreover, floods as compared to other environmental policy and governance issues (e.g., waste management, pollution control, water management) represent a direct threat to property, economic activity, and human life. Hence, flood risk management implies a need for concerted engagement and participation by different stakeholders; this can support the improvement of communities' social awareness and adaptability to confront flood hazards, and to develop locally accepted flood risk management plans and mitigation interventions. Past studies indicate that management strategies may fail if a participatory (modeling) risk approach that incorporates opinions and preferred policy options of stakeholders and local authorities, is not considered.Problems in stakeholder engagement processes related to flood risk management include a lack of institutional support, as well as clear and effective guidelines of stakeholder engagement processes, and lack of communication, information sharing, and resources with special reference to large participation processes. In this context, an innovative methodology to initialize the involvement of key stakeholders in the development of qualitative system dynamic models, i.e., causal loop diagrams (CLDs), has been used. CLDs are based on the development of mental models for the ``co-construction'' of participatory modeling and allow for the direct involvement of stakeholders with limited technical skills, even in situations with limited financial resources and time availability. The main advantage of CLDs is to provide a holistic picture of the complete system by representing interactions between different variables and helping to understand the feedbacks between different system components.The proposed methodology consists of five main stages: (i) definition of the problem; (ii) stakeholder analysis and identification of key groups; (iii) interviews with key stakeholders for the construction of the individual causal loop diagrams, (iv) merging of individual CLDs into an overall group CLD of the entire system to form a holistic qualitative model of the system; and finally, (v) an innovative methodology is proposed to reduce the complexity of the final merged causal loop diagram, making CLDs understandable for all kinds of stakeholders.In order to test the participatory modeling approach proposed in this study, a case study on a coastal area, historically affected by flood events, in the South of Italy was chosen. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach because stakeholders were able to think about various flood risk management policies and the results indicated socio-economic aspects that have not been considered by other technical and research studies conducted in the past. Participation emerged as an appropriate approach for enhancing flood risk management and all participating stakeholders indicated their satisfaction with the transparency of the modeling process and the overall group CLD model that depicts the aspects of a complex system in a clear, simple and understandable way.

abstract="Multiple change pressures from human activities and from climate variability and change affect water systems on land and at the coast and sea. Changes in these water systems in turn affect and feedback to multiple societal and ecosystem conditions and risks, e.g., for: water security and safety; food and energy security; human, animal and ecosystem health; and drought, flood and general climate-change mitigation/adaptation. Compound events with high societal and ecosystem impacts may result from various combinations of these water-related pressures and interactions. As a starting contribution to the European COST Action DAMOCLES, this study addresses the questions of: Which water-related compound events are most relevant for stakeholders? How much is currently known, by scientists and various stakeholders, about the multiple underlying variables and their inter-linkages for these events? What novel approaches can be used to ensure continuous stakeholder engagement?Using a ``source-to-sea water-link'' case study in the Baltic region, specifically the relatively well-studied Swedish Norrstr{\"o}m drainage basin and its adjacent and surrounding coastal areas and associated marine basin of the Baltic Sea, we apply a participatory approach to conceptual model building, involving relevant stakeholders for the land, coast and sea aspects of linked water-related pressures, changes and impacts, and their interactions. Use of this participatory approach can increase understanding of how stakeholders from different sectors view and think about these interactions, and facilitate collaborative exploration of cross-sectoral cooperation opportunities for research, applications and innovations regarding water-related high-impact compound events. As a main part of the study and its approach application, six workshops have been held with stakeholders from different land, coast and sea sectors. In these, mind maps and causal loop diagrams have been co-created by the involved stakeholders and scientists for key land-coast-sea interactions under climate change and socio-economic developments to identify associated connections among sectors with potential high social and environmental impacts. A main aim of this co-creation process is to identify and eventually model and quantify the main dynamic cause-effect links for these interactions and impacts. We here report and analyze the resulting mind maps and causal loop diagrams, and their similarities and differences, as co-created in the sector workshops based on their different focus themes and stakeholder perspectives. In synthesis, we also discuss the causal loop diagram implications for further systems modelling and quantification of key water-related compound events and their impacts.

Communication strategies were identified through interviews with adolescent Facebook users (N = 12), and coding Facebook data (N = 271 comments/posts). Three themes emerged from the data regarding tactics adolescents applied concerning effective online communication strategies: 1) level of relevancy (the extent to which the post related to their personal lives), 2) use of dialogical questions (the extent to which participants utilized engaging questions to solicit a response), and 3) social media savviness (the extent to which participants utilized images to convey information). Random permutation regression analysis indicated that those who demonstrated high performance levels in social media savviness were more central within the online community. Additionally, participants who applied dialogic questions held significantly higher scores in network betweenness. Implications for programing will be discussed.",

abstract="Purpose It is particularly important to study the learner cognition based on information technology and change of learning environment in e-learning. Therefore, based on the combination of knowledge management and e-learning, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the basic rules and existing problems of virtual learning community (VLC). Design/methodology/approach In this study, a set of principles and basic framework of VLC was proposed, which could effectively instruct the construction of knowledge and collective wisdom development of VLC. Meantime, this paper revealed and constructed the theoretical framework and learning model for facilitating the advance of collective intelligence, described the main characteristics of collaborative knowledge building and traced the trajectory of convergence of collective intelligence and verified them through case studies and field studies. Findings The author analyzed the characteristics of VLC assisting knowledge construction and traced the trajectory of convergence of collective intelligence. In this way, the learners not only construct the meaning of knowledge in the process of participation from the edge to the center, but also complete the transformation from a green hand to an old hand. As a result, the learners form a sense of belonging to the community and complete the identity construction as a member of the community in the process of co-constructing the cultural tradition and value orientation of the community. Research limitations/implications - The analysis of the framework is made relatively in general terms, and lacks of the concrete, practical analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the social network analysis method to carry out systematic research on the framework, so as to make the actual operation of the VLC more practical.

abstract="An increasing number of sustainable development strategies (SDS) is being developed for cities, municipalities and countries. The design of such strategies is inherently complex. This is a result from intricate relationships between different SDS on different levels, and a large number of requirements that need to be addressed in strategy implementation. A particular challenge is the integration of strategies across different governance levels (e.g., city, federal, and national levels). Methodologies are currently lacking to systematically design SDS which take the full complexity of the dependencies of the strategies into account. In this article, we propose a participatory requirements analyses approach to support strategy building across governance levels. Experience from systems engineering (SE) has shown, that requirements are the basis for designing systems or strategies. We elicit requirements by applying a participatory modeling approach with causal-loop diagrams in an individual interview setting. To illustrate our approach, we test the developed design approach and focus on the interdependencies between SDS at the city level (i.e., the cities of Berlin and Hamburg) and the German national SDS. The design process reveals critical factors which are needed for the overall success of the strategies. The resulting causal models reveal that despite coordination activities of the regional objectives with the national targets, trade-offs exist between the strategies regarding the underlying conditions for their implementation (e.g., national law, federal and state law). In addition, the level of detail of requirements for certain objectives at the national level and across sectors is too general. This hinders the emergence of system-wide co-benefits of possible solution strategies. Requirements analysis can highlight interdependencies, such as trade-offs and synergies, between strategies at multiple governance levels and, based upon this, can support a more coherent strategy design.",

Design/methodology/approach Six comparative case studies; three prospectively in Scotland using an action research-informed approach; and three retrospectively in England with variable degrees of success. The Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability framework explored interactions between multi-level contextual factors and their influence on efforts to introduce and sustain services. Findings Cross-boundary service development was a continuous process of adaptation and evolution in rapidly shifting healthcare context. Whilst the outer healthcare policy context differed significantly across cases, inner contextual features predominated in shaping the success or otherwise of service innovations. Technical and logistical issues, organisational resources, patient and staff actions combined in unpredictable ways to shape the lifecycle of service change. Patient and staff thoughts about place and access to services actively shaped service development. The use of tacit ``soft intelligence'' and a sense of ``chronic unease'' emerged as important in successfully navigating around awkward people and places. Originality/value This study has uniquely traced the fortunes of a single service innovation across diverse organisational and country contexts. Novel application of the NASSS framework enabled comparative analysis across real-time service change and historical failures. This study also adds to theories of context and complexity by surfacing the neglected role of patients in shaping healthcare context.",

abstract="Participatory modeling is a potentially high-impact approach for catalyzing fundamental sustainability transformations. We test if participation in a group system dynamics modeling exercise increases participants' agency through a novel method to evaluate potential behavioral change using expectation measures. A water-energy-food nexus-a functionally interdependent but underconceptualized system with low consensus and high scientific uncertainty-was mapped, and its evolution simulated by 46 participants in three interventions in a region undergoing hydropower infrastructure development in Northeastern Cambodia. Participants' system-related expectations were measured before and after the interventions. Our results suggest that participants became significantly more optimistic about their individual agency to increase agricultural and fishing income and, interestingly, less likely to participate in local government development planning procedures. Findings also reveal how some uncertainties for multiple variables were reduced within and across the groups. Such converging expectations suggest that participatory modeling could contribute to making collective solutions and institutionalized agreements more likely. This research contributes to innovation in sustainability because it unpacks some underlying mechanics of how participatory processes can lead to new adaptive capacities, shared perspectives, and collective actions.",

Education is acknowledged as a means for achieving the remaining Goals, with sustainability as a goal for education in target 4.7. However, the interconnectedness of the SDGs and the complexity of sustainability as a concept make it difficult to relate the SDGs to educational learning outcomes, with what Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) aims to achieve, left in ambiguity. Using systems thinking, we developed a framework that redefines ESD as a tool that can deliver the transformation required for society to reach a sustainable state. Using the SDGs as end points for this state, and through a participatory approach, education stakeholders and learners work together to construct a common vision of sustainability, identify the competences needed, and develop appropriate pedagogies and learning strategies. The framework allows for the development of evaluation tools that can support educational institutions to monitor and manage their progress in transforming societies towards sustainability.",

abstract="Purpose This paper aims to develop a novel risk analysis model that uses both participatory and computerized techniques to capture and model the dynamic of risk impact propagation and interaction pattern. Design/methodology/approach In this research, an integrated model, applying modified participatory method and novel dichotomize procedure in the perspectives of social network topological analysis, is developed. Findings Based on the analysis output, it is found that; (i) the risk propagation is characterized by its dynamic and non-linear impact pattern, and (ii) the risk interaction is distinguished based on the degree of connectedness between various risks. Research limitations/implications - This research assumes that the risk impact propagation and interaction pattern within the risk network are static. Further research is required to analyze the risk network in dynamic circumstances. Practical implications - This research contributes in delivering practical tools that could potentially provide a further path for developing mitigation strategy and policies that seek to address the complexity of risk phenomena, and thus enhance community resilience. Social implications - This research reveals some underlying patterns of how the risk impact propagation and interaction pattern are structured. Thus, it can help decision-makers make formal arrangements of particular urban infrastructure (UI) governance visible toward building risk plan and mitigation strategies. Originality/value This research contributes to filling the risk management knowledge gap. It is suggested that analyzing risk using a network approach is suited to capture the intricate processes that shape the complexity of UI risk structural network. By validating the model, this research shows the applicability and capability of the model to improve both the RA accuracy and decision making effectiveness towards risk mitigation plan and strategy.",

abstract="Collective action within territorial organizations is complex. Initiatives often collapse from a lack of understanding of relational dynamics and logics of action. This article proposes a relational approach to study the collective action process within a producer association of a Localized Agrifood System (LAS). We conducted the research within the APROCAMPOS association, located in the Serrano cheese LAS, which involves producer families, extension agents, inspection veterinarians and secretaries of agriculture. We first conducted a social network analysis of advice seeking within the association, through sociometric interviews with the producer members. Second, an analysis of territorial proximity, conducted through semi-structured interviews with the association participants, was combined with the social network analysis. Results showed that extension agents are in a very central position in the advice network. They follow a classical top down model of knowledge diffusion. The president of the association plays a key brokerage role, essential for the network cohesion and information flow. Second, the analyses revealed a lack of trust and reciprocity among producers, leading to a low level of interaction and collective action, which can, however, be improved by the combination of geographical and organized proximities. In sum, the top-down model leads to low levels of initiative and participation among the producers in collective action. Local knowledge needs to be integrated in a more participatory governance frame to build common projects of cheese valorization. Nonetheless, institutional arrangements appear instrumental to define political orientation that favors cooperation and meets the quality of the Serrano cheese and promotes the development of the territory as a whole.",

abstract="Network structures have drawn a lot of research interest in recent years. However, little is known about how the diversity, complexity, and structure of the multi-actor networks associated with a project shapes information exchange and linkages in different contexts. This study, conducted in 2017, addresses this deficiency by analyzing the social networks in three villages, and it was directly set up in response to operationalizing a smallholder dairy development project. Social network analysis was used to characterize the networks and to look into network configuration and information exchange dynamics. Data were collected through household-level interviews with the project's participant farmers and key project stakeholders, supplemented with other Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques. Analysis focused on network visualization and estimation of specific network parameters for comparison. Results indicated that public sector actors were the key drivers in all these smallholder networks. Flow of information was favored both vertically and horizontally in the network, which was configured at a later stage, rather than in the project piloting stages, owing to unique actor alignment and multiplicity of ties. The networks were also found to vary in terms of some of the network attributes, signaling varying levels of network integration and brokerage potential. Better cohesiveness and information spread was observed in the network, which had the right mix of information acquisition and exchange networks. The study offers valuable lessons with respect to connectedness of network actors, need for multi-actor alliance, and implication of centrality measures in determining network dynamics.",

It explores the dynamic nature of the support system, the feedback loops, nonlinearity, underpinning ``rules,'' and associated behaviour. The tenets of complexity theory are applied to identify characteristics of the system, which, in turn, provide insight into ways of achieving change. The study demonstrates that these health professionals were behaving in ways which they thought were expected, rather than being ``nice'' to each other: behaviour that was driven by the inherent interrelatedness within an organization or system. This finding not only has significant outcomes for practice but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the emergent nature of complexity theory.",

keywords="collaborative modeling social learning systems-based thinking stakeholder engagement trinity of voice natural resource management Sikkim India KNOWLEDGE PARTICIPATION ADAPTATION",
abstract="In an effort to address challenges arising out of traditional forms of public participation, several alternative strategies for encouraging stakeholder engagement in conservation have been implemented. The role of social learning in addressing these ecological complexities has gained increasing attention in natural resource management over the last decade. Social learning forms the backbone of any collaborative conceptual modeling of complex human-environmental systems. Collaborative modeling, grounded in social learning theory, is the practice of building models with rather than for stakeholders. By enabling stakeholders to co-design and/or make joint decisions within the modeling process, collaboration manifests itself as cooperation and joint action through interactive, iterative, and reflective processes. Using a case study conducted in East Sikkim, India, we hypothesize that in situations where opportunities for formal environmental education are limited, and avenues for meaningful stakeholder engagement are few, collaborative modeling can help create a platform where stakeholders have meaningful opportunities to engage, learn, share, and (re)negotiate with a focus on joint problem solving. In particular, we engaged stakeholders in an iterative collaborative modeling process in an attempt to enable them to (1) openly interact with each other, (2) build trust, (3) unfold mutual interdependencies through social learning and thus see themselves as part of a complex human-dominated ecosystem, and (4) build and translate these shared visions toward collaborative forest management in the region. Using Senecah's Trinity of Voice as an analytical framework, we further examined how participation in the collaborative modeling process provided stakeholders with access, standing, and influence-the three critical dimensions of ``voice.'' Our results demonstrate that the collaborative modeling process enabled key stakeholders to unfold mutual interdependencies, and opened spaces for critical thinking, knowledge (re)creation, sharing, and trust building. By moving beyond narrow technical strategies for conservation, the collaborative modeling process helped create a platform that provided stakeholders with voice-a chance to share their environmental knowledge, experiences, and joint visions toward addressing and managing the growing uncertainties of complex human-dominated systems.",

abstract="While higher-order predators like wolves (canis lupus) serve important ecological roles within social-ecological systems, prior studies indicated differences in the acknowledgement of these roles by specific stakeholder groups. As diverging underlying mental models may cause these differences in the societal valuation of the species, there is a need for the development of innovative methods to systematically uncover stakeholders' interests and their conceptions about relevant conservation issues. This paper proposes a concept mapping technique as a suitable way to investigate stakeholders' mental models based on their understanding of underlying reasons, consequences and solutions for a selected conservation issue. To illustrate the utilization of the methodology, we present a case study about the conservation of returning wolves in Lower Saxony, a region within North-West Germany. In the case study, we used a concept mapping task within face-to-face interviews to investigate the mental models of nine stakeholders from the three most important interest groups of hunters, shepherds, and conservationists. After the inductive categorization of the resulting qualitative data, we ordered the resulting categories into matrices with a rank order cluster (ROC) algorithm and found different underlying reasons and consequences for the conservation conflict. Thereby, we were able to identify 19 individual solutions, which however differed concerning their consensus between stakeholder groups. Only the consequence-oriented solution of supporting livestock owners was mentioned by all stakeholder groups. Overall, we were able to subsume stakeholders' solutions into three implementation spaces (human-human focused, population-management related and consequence-oriented solutions). While the solutions indicated possible case-specific interventions, the implementation spaces may be interesting for a further investigation within other conservation cases, and may illustrate how underlying mental models may be used to determine successful strategies for conservation management.

Here, the design and application of the participatory simulation game Global Sustainability Crossroads is described, based on a global state-of-the-art energy-economy-environment model, which creates a virtual scenario where the participants are confronted with the design of climate mitigation strategies as well as the social, economic, and environmental consequences of decisions. The novelty of the game rests on the global scope and the representation of the drivers of anthropogenic emissions within the MEDEAS-World model, combined with a participatory simulation group dynamic flexible enough to be adapted to a diversity of contexts and participants. The performance of 13 game workshops with similar to 420 players has shown it has a significant pedagogical potential: the game is able to generate discussions on crucial topics which are usually outside the public realm such as the relationship between economic growth and sustainability, the role of technology, how human desires are limited by biophysical constraints or the possibility of climate tipping points.",

abstract="Numerical modeling efforts in support of restoration and protection activities in coastal Louisiana have traditionally been conducted externally to any stakeholder engagement processes. This separation has resulted in planning- and project-level models built solely on technical observation and analysis of natural processes. Despite its scientific rigor, this process often fails to account for the knowledge, values, and experiences of local stakeholders that often contextualizes a modeled system. To bridge this gap, a team of natural and social scientists worked directly with local residents and resource users to develop a participatory modeling approach to collect and utilize local knowledge about the Breton Sound Estuary in southeast Louisiana, USA. Knowledge capture was facilitated through application of a local knowledge mapping methodology designed to catalog local understanding of current and historical conditions within the estuary and identify desired ecological and hydrologic end states. The results of the mapping endeavor informed modeling activities designed to assess the applicability of the identified restoration solutions. This effort was aimed at increasing stakeholder buy-in surrounding the utility of numerical models for planning and designing coastal protection and restoration projects and included an ancillary outcome aimed at elevating stakeholder empowerment regarding the design of nature-based restoration solutions and modeling scenarios. This intersection of traditional science and modeling activities with the collection and analysis of traditional ecological knowledge proved useful in elevating the confidence that community members had in modeled restoration outcomes.",

abstract="Environmental management decisions increasingly rely on quantitative ecological models to forecast potential outcomes of management actions. These models are becoming increasingly complex through the integration of processes from multiple disciplines (e.g., linking engineering and ecological models). Understandably, these models are often viewed as mysterious, baffling black boxes, which can lead to mistrust, misinterpretation and/or misapplication of model results. Numerical models have historically been developed without decision makers, coordinating partners, or stakeholders playing active roles in model development, which further complicates communication as diverse project teams have differing levels of understanding of models and their uses. Ultimately, mistrust of models and associated outputs can lead to poor decision-making, increase the risk of ineffective decisions, and lead to litigation over decisions. Improved ecological model development practices are needed to increase transparency, include stakeholders and decision makers throughout the entire modeling process from conceptualization through application, and overcome common communication barriers. Building from participatory modeling and prototyping methods, we have developed a workshop approach for applied ecosystem modeling problems that cultivates a foundational understanding of ecological models through hands-on, interactive model development. In this workshop environment, interdisciplinary and interagency working groups co-develop models in real-time which demystifies technical issues and educates participants on the modeling process. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a repeatable mediated modeling workshop and identify its utility in overcoming major communication challenges of integrated modeling for complex environmental problems. The workshop approach informs modeling teams of the complexity facing decision-makers, creates a sense of model ownership by participants, builds trust among partners, and ultimately increases ``buy-in'' of the eventual decision.",

Over the course of 12 months, the authors conducted one focus group interview and three design workshops with participating teachers and master teachers. Between the workshops, the team rapidly iterated the framework, as well as curricular materials, in collaboration with the teachers. Findings The authors developed a curriculum unit that integrates systems dynamics visualization tools and a video game for middle school life science ecosystem curriculum. The unit was implemented by the three teachers who participated in the co-design. The implementations confirmed the flexibility of the unit because teachers created additional instructional materials that supplemented the GBSD protocol and addressed the unique limitations and needs of their classrooms. Originality/value GBSD builds on system dynamics, which is a distinct academic discipline and methodology, and it uses its visualization tools, which are not widely used in the systems thinking educational literature. GBSD is also unique, in that it applies these tools within the debriefing activities developed for an off-the-shelf educational game. This paper illustrates how a design framework can be used to support teachers' thoughtful integration of games in curriculum development.",

abstract="Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a multidimensional understanding of the management of feedback from customer product returns and the management practices that lead to the occurrence of product returns in the context of knowledge management. The characteristics of product returns indicate that to manage them requires specific knowledge management, as the nature of their management is rather complex. Design/methodology/approach Understanding of feedback concept for the purpose of product returns avoidance management and its linkages with knowledge management through the theoretical review was performed first. Second, soft systems methodology (SSM) to analyze the very complex situation, as the product returns present, provided the conceptual framework for empirical research. The principles and best practices of SSM were followed and an analysis of documents together with the theoretical knowledge of feedback, product returns and knowledge management served as the basis for the action research. Findings The research highlighted the importance of knowledge management (even in a rather simple form) for the solution of the problematic situation and underlined the necessary interconnections between different areas of business processes management and the need to manage knowledge. It also showed that product returns act as important feedback for the whole organization. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to apply current knowledge of the feedback construct into the knowledge and product returns management. It is also the first attempt to apply SSM to product returns management.",

Design/methodology/approach This research employs interactive management (IM) methodology to construct a model achieving the research purpose. The IM methodology is anchored in the soft systems thinking. Its inquiry process mainly comprises four phases: idea generation, idea clarification, idea structuring and interpretation of the structured ideas. The IM methodology allows the relevant stakeholders to collaboratively develop a digraph displaying the interrelationship among the system elements. Findings The participants of the IM session structured a systemic model showing that a loop comprising three factors is the driver leading to the delays in the electrical distribution projects. The three delay factors in the loop are ``poor communication'', ``poor planning'' and ``project scheduling not properly done''. Originality/value The findings show that a loop comprising three delay factors is the driver leading to the project delays. This result is different from the outputs of the commonly used approaches. The three identified root causes serve as the starting point for eradicating delays in the electrical distribution projects.",

abstract="Existing research shows that the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for healthcare development in developing countries is largely dominated by donor and international agencies, but the actual organizational-level decisions are often driven by corporate healthcare managers. The consequences of the strategic-driven healthcare ICT adoption practices are that they fail to match clinician users' requirements and cause them to disuse ICTs for clinical practices and healthcare development. Prior attempts to bring local and globally-distributed actors together to implement ICTs innovatively for healthcare development have emphasized less on synthesizing the diverse information system approaches that inform our understanding of how to narrow the 'manager-clinician' tensions in ICT adoption for development in emergent situations. To fill this gap, this article explains the process of shifting healthcare ICT adoption from top-down planning to collective user involvement to enhance clinicians' acceptance of ICTs for clinical practices and development in a Ghanaian teaching hospital, using the cohered emergent transformation model. Action research was used to engage the hospital's corporate managers, clinician managers and clinicians, and elicit their views and experiences of the hospital's ICT adoption for healthcare delivery improvement. Together with observations and document analysis, the data was analyzed to understand the hospital's information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) adoption issues and identify ways of managing them. The outcomes provide alternative theoretical and practical ways of adopting healthcare technology systems that shift the excessive use of managers' powers in ICT adoption towards clinicians' involvement, to enable technology acceptance for clinical practices and healthcare development.",

abstract="With the increasing prominence of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in higher education, the number of programmes and studies integrating online peer interaction opportunities on social media, likewise, has surged. Nevertheless, little quantitative research has been performed on the ways in which learners interact with one another via these platforms for academic purposes. As a result, little is known about how learners develop a network of peers and how they interact with this peer group through social media tools. This paper analyses the peer interaction process in a Facebook environment, integrated into the foreign language curriculum at university level. In two consecutive years, two groups of Belgian first-year foreign language learners of English (N = 119, N = 112) were invited to consult with a community of learners about their learning trajectory via the platform. Through social network analysis, it is determined which topics, challenges and personal experiences students discuss on Facebook and how these are embedded in the peer interaction process overall. While the two learner groups have different approaches to addressing learning challenges and needs, certain topics and activities consistently co-occur in interaction sequences, exemplifying how learners tend to provide scaffolded support and co-construct knowledge online. This study shows how learners can develop both their learning and language ability as a scaffolded, dialogic process within an online social networking environment when having access to a combination of information and learning resources.",

abstract="With the purpose of limiting the drastically increasing quantity of travel volumes and the sustainability of urban traffic systems, many cities have implemented urban traffic restriction (UTR) policies. However, insufficient stakeholder involvement in UTR policy assessment often leads to a lack of social and political support, in addition to a lack of acceptability with respect to policy implementation. In this background, participatory system dynamics modeling (PSDM) is presented as a methodology to engage stakeholders in UTR policy assessment. By the proposed methodology, a comprehensive case study of UTR policy in the city of Xi'an was illustrated. Based on the assessment results, the leverage point influencing the performance of the UTR policy was identified and discussed, with different policy scenarios simulated and tested. The simulation results show that developing public transportation while implementing UTR policy was indicated as the most reasonable solution at the present stage, and the annual growth rate of private cars should be monitored in the future. The results confirmed that the PSDM methodology can facilitate the system thinking of stakeholders, which is important to reach consensus-based assessment results and to enhance the social support for UTR policy.",

abstract="Marine protected areas (MPAs) remain central to the conservation of marine biodiversity, but enhancing their resilience under climate change require that organizations managing them are able to adapt. Social factors like institutions can affect organizational capacities to adapt to climate change. Yet our knowledge about how different institutional designs for protected areas affect management adaptive capacity is limited. We address this gap by comparing how two models of MPA governance - centralized and collaborative (co-management) - influence the adaptive capacities of public organizations managing MPAs in East Africa. Social network analysis is used to examine external relations of MPA organizations which are interpreted through the lens of social capital theory to explain the acquisition of information and knowledge that support adaptive capacity. We find differences in the ways focal MPA organizations in the centralized and co-managed MPA systems are connected to their external partners. In the centralized system, the focal MPA organization operates in a less connected network rich in opportunities to bridge disconnected groups that can be a source of novel and diverse information. Conversely, the focal MPA organization in the co-managed system operates in a dense network of interconnected organizations that are likely to have similar information, therefore providing redundant information benefits. The composition of partners around focal MPA organizations which determines information quality is not affected by MPA governance context. We conclude that institutional context affects the relational dimensions of adaptive capacity, by giving greater or fewer opportunities for the development of either bridging or bonding social capital.",

abstract="Valorising the biocultural heritage of common goods could enable peasant farmers to achieve socially and economically inclusive sustainability. Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. Identifying the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective requires an integrative framework. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the ``commoning'' process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain outside recognition for their production and thus achieve social and economic inclusion. Despite the differences in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the privileged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.",

The present paper details innovative methods for strengthening the learning process through better social accountability. The paper defines and tests in rural schools of Afghanistan and Pakistan a community-based system dynamics protocol using participatory group model building (GMB) techniques. We tested the protocol with two groups of teachers and one group of children, with the three produced causal loop diagrams highlighting factors that influence learning in the classroom from the perspectives of the participants. The sessions showed interest, engagement, quick mastery of how GMB methods work and clear understanding of how the current classroom system hinders learning for many students. Researchers found that large autonomy and initiative could be left to the workshop participants, keeping the facilitator's role to one of explaining the method and asking clarification about causal relations.",

abstract="Coherent responses to important problems such as climate change require involving a multitude of stakeholders in a transformative process leading to development of policy pathways. The process of coming to an agreement on policy pathways requires critical reflection on underlying system conceptualizations and commitment to building capacity in all stakeholders engaged in a social learning process. Simulation models can support such processes by providing a boundary object or negotiating artifact that allows stakeholders to deliberate through a multi-interpretable, consistent, transparent, and verifiable representation of reality. The challenge is how to structure the transdisciplinary process of involving stakeholders in simulation modeling and how to know when such a process can be labeled as transformative. There is a proliferation of approaches for this across disciplines, of which this article identifies Group Model Building, Companion Modeling, Challenge-and-Reconstruct Learning, and generic environmental modeling as the most prominent. This article systematically reviews relevant theories, terminology, principles, and methodologies across these four approaches to build a framework that can facilitate further learning. The article also provides a typology of approaches to modeling with stakeholders. It distinguishes transformative approaches that involve stakeholders from representative, instrumental and nominal forms. It is based on an extensive literature review, supported by twenty-three semi-structured interviews with participatory and non-participatory modelers. The article brings order into the abundance of conceptions of transformation, the role of simulation models in transformative change processes, the role of participation of stakeholders, and what type of approaches to modeling with stakeholders are befitting in the development of policy pathways.",

Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a case study of a private sector organisation based in New Zealand and its efforts in implementing CI activities in its public sector clients. In total, 12 semi-structured interviews were followed by group model building exercises based on system dynamics that led to the development of a systems model. Findings - CI initiatives using public-private partnerships were successful in steadily improving the operational excellence and end-user satisfaction in this case. But client satisfaction was only increasing at a much slower rate. The underlying structure responsible for this behaviour was captured using a causal loop model and explained using seven interacting feedback loops. Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this research is that it is confined to one private sector organisation and its public sector clients. Thus, the generalisability cannot be utilised for future reference. Practical implications - This paper illustrates the development of strategic initiatives based on a participative model building approach. It provides a practical method for initiating long-term structural changes while managing CI activities in public sector organisations.

abstract="When faced with wicked and messy problems, practitioners can rely on a variety of problem structuring methods (PSMs). Although previous efforts have been made to combine such methods with simulation, currently, few exist that integrate a simulation capability within problem structuring. Our integrated approach named MARVEL (method to analyse relations between variables using enriched loops) shares some techniques with established methods such as the PSM SODA (strategic options development and analysis), system dynamics, and fuzzy cognitive maps. In addition, MARVEL uses causal loop diagrams that are enriched with qualitatively labelled values and standardized equations. This makes analyses of both model structure and behaviour possible. MARVEL also maintains the benefits of a PSM, such as being cognitively accessible for a wide variety of actors. The current paper presents MARVEL in technical terms, and discusses the similarities and differences it has with the aforementioned methods. We then present a case study that discusses how MARVEL was used in a collaborative setting to facilitate stakeholders' assessment of tactical military actions during stabilization operations.",

abstract="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a systemic analysis of the complex interaction of factors affecting the reverse logistics (RL) processes in a pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC). Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a systems thinking approach. Initial problem structuring involved the analysis of behavior-over-time of main variables and incorporated stakeholder analysis. Further, a participative group model building process was used to develop a systems model. Findings - The model was analysed to identify a set of feedback loops operating in the system responsible for the complexities of the problem. To address this, the stakeholders identified three strategic interventions. The first intervention relates to returns avoidance by alleviating market flooding of medicines, second intervention aims at improving the infrastructure for quality and performance management and the third targets balanced risk sharing between the main stakeholders involved in the supply chain. The findings suggest strong linkage between RL network design and key activities in returns management. The study lays a platform for developing a simulation model. Research limitations/implications - Data collection was confined to stakeholders belonging to a PSC based in the South Indian state of Kerala and excluded the participation of doctors due to practical constraints. The application of systems thinking and modelling was limited to the qualitative phases of the methodology. Practical implications - The study illustrates a participative process capable of revealing the differing viewpoints of multiple stakeholders involved in a PSC. Originality/value - It provides a holistic approach based on the systems thinking and modelling methodology for analysing the complexities related to RL in the Indian pharmaceutical industry.",

abstract="This paper reports on the development and structure of a framework - ScriptsMap - intended to facilitate the design of mixed method policy-making workshops. The ScriptsMap framework aims to provide a means of articulating and combining activities (which a script specifies) from two or more methods so that a facilitator or group facilitation team can construct, with the framework's aid, a thoughtful and careful design for a workshop. To provide an example of the framework, the combination of system dynamics group model building and group problem structuring incorporating causal mapping with the use of a Group Support System is used. The paper will illustrate ScriptsMap's structure through an example of the use of the framework in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

abstract="Mental models are the cognitive representations of the world that frame how people interact with the world. Learning implies changing these mental models. The successful management of complex social-ecological systems requires the coordination of actions to achieve shared goals. The coordination of actions requires a level of shared understanding of the system or situation; a shared or common mental model. We first describe the elicitation and analysis of mental models of different stakeholder groups associated with water management in the Camargue Biosphere Reserve in the Rhone River delta on the French Mediterranean coast. We use cultural consensus analysis to explore the degree to which different groups shared mental models of the whole system, of stakeholders, of resources, of processes, and of interactions among these last three. The analysis of the elicited data from this group structure enabled us to tentatively explore the evidence for learning in the nonstatute Water Board; comprising important stakeholders related to the management of the central Rhone delta. The results indicate that learning does occur and results in richer mental models that are more likely to be shared among group members. However, the results also show lower than expected levels of agreement with these consensual mental models. Based on this result, we argue that a careful process and facilitation design can greatly enhance the functioning of the participatory process in the Water Board. We conclude that this methodology holds promise for eliciting and comparing mental models. It enriches group-model building and participatory approaches with a broader view of social learning and knowledge-sharing issues.",

abstract="This paper describes a group model-building project about new housing construction, urban renewal and the impact of both processes on a regional social housing market. A team of seven stakeholders participated in model construction over a 1-year period. The paper addresses the modeling process, model analysis and policy experiments. The model yielded several counterintuitive insights, helped the stakeholders to settle a contentious issue and was used in flight simulator workshops with managers and policy makers. By means of questionnaires, we found that most attendants in the project or workshops consider system dynamics modeling as improving communication, insight, alignment and commitment to results.

abstract="This paper summarises a system dynamics pilot study analysing the relationship of New Zealand Customs Service (NZCS) outputs to desired government outcomes, in relation to the collection of tobacco excise duties and cigarette smoking in New Zealand. The study was done to demonstrate the utility of system dynamics in answering some questions of a type common in the New Zealand public sector during policy development and review. Group model-building workshops addressed the organising question: ``How does price influence the use and consequences of tobacco in New Zealand?'' A prototype system dynamics simulation model using the ithink dynamic simulation software was developed, consisting of seven sectors: NZCS air and marine sector; duty-paid cigarette imports; duty-free cigarettes; New Zealand tobacco manufacturing sector; NZCS duty collection (from air passengers); New Zealand tobacco products market; and a health sector. The model simulates values of the model variables on an annual basis from 2000 to 2010. Policy experiments with the model include examining the effects of changes in excise duties. The model can be further developed to examine tobacco-related public policy issues in New Zealand and complement modelling done in other countries. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

abstract="The system dynamics group at the Rockefeller College of the University at Albany has been developing techniques to create system dynamic models with groups of managers during the last 25 years. Building upon their tradition in decision conferencing, the group has developed a particular style that involves a facilitation team in which people play different roles. Throughout these years of experience, the group has also developed several ``scripts'' to elicit knowledge from experts based on small-groups research, and well-established practices in the development of system dynamics models. This paper constitutes a detailed documentation of a relatively small-scale modeling effort that took place in early 2001, offering a ``soup to nuts'' description of group model building at Albany. The paper describes in detail nine of the scripts that the group has developed, offering some reflections about their advantages and limitations. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

abstract="System dynamics provides a powerful support mechanism for resolving problems in highly complex and dynamic contexts. Effectively building a system dynamics model in a client-group environment is a challenging task, particularly with a heterogeneous clientele and a variety of stakeholders influencing the boundaries of the model. In such environments, understanding and formulating central concerns is as important as it is challenging. This article describes a group model building initiative designed to study the implications of various policies aimed at revitalizing the fishing industry in Gloucester, Massachusetts. While the iterative and interactive methods in this group modeling intervention helped fishermen and community members to communicate effectively with one another, define problems and improve their understanding of the critical interactions in the system, the resulting model was used to help the Gloucester Community Development Cooperation to communicate potential impacts of a prospective fish factory to a wider audience.

abstract="In recent years the human dimension and governance issues have gained more and more in importance in the management of natural resources. One important aspect is to understand the processes of social learning that precede any collective decision-making. The HarmoniCOP project developed a framework for social learning for resources management that can be interpreted as combining content management as well as social involvement processes to achieve both technical and relational outcomes. Social learning was taken into account in a new approach called participatory agent based social simulation. Participatory agent based social simulation deviates in a number of ways from conventional modelling. The actors themselves whose behaviour is represented in the model and who are supposed to later use the models for decision-making and strategic planning, participate and contribute to the modelling process. Models serve as tools of communication in processes of social learning. This article reports on a Swiss case study which dealt with the development of new management strategies for urban water management. It will provide examples of how different techniques can be used to establish a process of social learning within a long-term participatory management project using participatory agent-based social simulation. Social learning is highlighted as important for management regimes that require changes in social practices, roles and responsibilities. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",
